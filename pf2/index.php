        <p>One subtier: Use the challenge point system to determine any adjustments. If
        the table would direct you to run the high subtier, instead run the adventure
        with the level bump and the 6-player adjustment.</p>

        <p>More than two subtiers: Pick two subtiers that are next to each other and that
        include all of your PCs, and determine the appropriate challenge based on that.
        If all of your players are in the same subtier, then it does not matter which
        adjacent subtier you pick&#8212;the system will give you the same result.</p>

        <h4>Calculating Challenge Points</h4>

        <p>1: Record the PCs' levels.</p>

        <p>Challenge Point totals of 12&#8211;13 and 23&#8211;27 allow the GM to make a
        choice between two options that provide a similar degree of challenge. However,
        each scenario varies slightly in the differences between these two options, and
        the GM is encouraged to select the option they predict will be a more fun and
        fair challenge for the group. (Parties often prefer options that give the PCs
        more monsters to fight.) You can pick between the options individually for each
        encounter.</p>

        <p>5: Apply a level bump to any PCs who have the lowest level within the
        tier(high subtier only).</p>

        <p>6: Apply the subtier and the adjustments.</p>

        <h4>Applying the Modifications</h4>

        <p>Level Bump for Adventures: Scenarios and quests are designed to challenge PCs
        whose average level is the lower of the two levels in a given subtier. Applying a
        level bump is a simple calculation:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Increase every DC listed in the scenario by 1.</li>

          <li>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw
          modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and ACs of all enemy
          creatures by 1.</li>

          <li>Increase the Hit Point totals of all enemy creatures by 10 or by 10%,
          whichever is higher.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Level Bump for PCs: When a PC of the lowest legal level for an adventure plays
        in the high subtier, they also gain the level bump benefits listed above for the
        duration of the adventure, but instead applied to their character's Armor Class,
        DCs, modifiers, and Hit Points.</p>

        <h4>Hero Points</h4>

        <p>At the beginning of an adventure, each player receives 1 Hero Point. GMs can
        then hand out additional Hero Points throughout the session in recognition of the
        characters' deeds, at a rate of approximately 1 Hero Point per hour of play. When
        handing out Hero Points, try to spread them out throughout the table rather than
        giving most of the points to one player.</p>

        <p>Players who have earned GM glyphs can hand out one additional hero point per
        Glyph at the start of the adventure when boons are slotted.&nbsp; But no player
        can receive more than 1 hero point this way per adventure.&nbsp;</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-3" id="middlecolumn">
        
        <h4 id="purchasing-guidelines">Purchasing Guidelines</h4>

        <p>You can always purchase the following items so long as you're in a
        settlement of at least 5,000 residents (and scenarios may sometimes provide
        additional allowances or limitations):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Any common equipment in sanctioned Pathfinder content with an item level
          equal to or less than your character's level (minimum 2).</li>

          <li>Any uncommon equipment in sanctioned Pathfinder content with an item level
          equal to or less than your character's level (minimum 2); your character must
          have access to this uncommon equipment such as through meeting its Access
          condition.</li>

          <li>Any equipment listed on your character's Chronicle sheets with an item
          level equal to or less than your character's level + 2. Some items found on
          Chronicle sheets are available for purchase only a limited number of
          times.</li>

          <li>Any items and services purchased with Fame.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that accumulating Infamy can reduce the character's effective level when
        purchasing equipment.</p>


        <h4>Advancement Speed</h4>

        <p>Pathfinder Society characters can choose between two different advancement
        speeds, allowing them to gain levels and rewards more quickly or to slow down
        their advancement (such as to extend their character's career or allow new
        players to catch up). It is entirely possible for different PCs at a table to use
        different advancement speeds with no impact on the game. At the beginning of the
        adventure, you choose which of the two advancement speeds to use.</p>

        <p><strong>Standard Advancement:</strong> You gain the full XP, gp, Downtime,
        Fame, and Reputation rewards earned in the adventure.</p>

        <p><strong>Slow Advancement:</strong> You gain half of the XP, gp, Downtime,
        Fame, and Reputation rewards earned in the adventure.</p>

        <h4>Experience Points</h4>

        <p>Each time you play an adventure, your character will gain Experience Points
        (XP). Typically, you gain 1 XP for completing a quest, 4 XP for completing a
        scenario, or even 12 XP for completing most sanctioned Pathfinder Adventure or
        Adventure Path volumes. For every 12 XP your character earns, they advance 1
        level. You cannot delay increasing your character's level once they earn the
        requisite number of XP.</p>

        <h4 id="fame-and-reputation">Fame and Reputation</h4>

        <p>A quest can grant up to 1 Fame and 1 Reputation. A scenario can grant up to 4
        Fame and 4 Reputation, though scenarios with the Faction tag typically have an
        opportunity to gain additional Reputation with the associated faction. Sanctioned
        Pathfinder Adventures and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes typically grant up to
        12 Fame and 12 Reputation.</p>


        <h4>Treasure</h4>

        <p>At the end of the adventure, the GM crosses out any items the PCs did not
        discover.</p>

        <h4 id="downtime">Downtime</h4>

        <p>A quest grants 2 days of Downtime, a scenario grants 8 days, and a sanctioned
        Pathfinder Adventure or Adventure Path typically grants 24 days of Downtime. If
        your character is a field-commissioned agent (rather than having trained with the
        Scrolls, Spells, and Swords Pathfinder Schools), they earn an additional 50% as
        many days of Downtime, earning 3, 12, and 36 days respectively.</p>

        <p>A character can use Downtime in a variety of ways, including the Crafting,
        Earn Income, and retraining options in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>.
        Downtime must be spent at the end of the session or it expires; it cannot be
        stockpiled for later use. However, players can spend their Downtime to start or
        continue an activity such as Crafting an item that requires multiple adventures'
        worth of Downtime to complete.</p>
