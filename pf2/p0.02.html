<p>This short guide is for players who are new to Pathfinder Society. It explains the basics of how to join the Pathfinder Society and play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play games.</p>
<p><span id="more-456"></span></p>
<h2 id="register">Register for Organized Play</h2>
<p>To ensure you have access to all the tools and benefits available to our players, you need to register a <strong>paizo.com</strong> account for organized play.   If you have not yet created an account, you can do so by navigating to <a href="https://paizo.com/">paizo.com</a>, clicking “Sign In” in the upper righthand corner of the page, and then clicking the “Create New Account” button and following the instructions on the following pages.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created a <strong>paizo.com</strong> account, log in and hover over the “My Account” tab in the upper-right corner of the screen and select “Organized Play” from the dropdown menu (for mobile phone users, you may need to tap on “My Account” for the dropdown to appear). This will take you to your personalized Paizo Organized Play page. From here, you can download a copy of your Organized Play ID Card, examine or update any of the characters you register, and view a log of the sessions you’ve played.</p>
<p><strong id="register-new-character">To register a new character</strong>, click “Register a New Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) Character” near the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t have a chance to register before your first game</strong>, your Game Master (GM) will give you an Organized Play ID number you can input when you do register to get credit for that game.</p>
<h2>Learn the Community Standards</h2>
<p>All participants in Organized Play must adhere to the <a href="#community-standards">community standards</a>—read through them and uphold them at all Organized Play events and sessions.</p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>Next, you need a character to play. You can either use a pre-generated character or create your own character.</p>
<h3>Using a Pregenerated Character</h3>
<p>If you don’t have time to create a new character or want to try out a new character class, you can use a pregenerated character, also called a pregen. The Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild offers free pregenerated characters based on Pathfinder’s iconic characters, available at<strong> <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">paizo.com</a></strong> or from your local event coordinator. You can find more information on pregenerated characters <a href="#pregenerated-characters">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
<p>Character creation for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild follows the guidelines in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, with a few additional Roleplaying Guild-specific rules and benefits. <a href="#character-creation">Character Creation</a>  contains step-by-step instructions to help you create your own Roleplaying Guild character and explains organization’s special rules and benefits. Read instructions rules carefully to ensure your character is suitable for the organized play campaign. All Pathfinder Society characters must start at 1st level.</p>
<p><strong>Character Options:</strong> All of the ancestries, backgrounds, and classes from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are available to you when creating a character. You may need to spend <a href="#player-rewards-boons">Achievement Points</a>  to access some ancestries and options from other books before you can use them in organized play. More information on approved resources can be found in the upcoming Character Options document.</p>
<h2>Before the Adventure Session</h2>
<p>At the game table, introduce yourself to the other players and the Game Master. Take this time to determine which character within the adventure’s tier (range of levels) you want to play—this can be a character you created or a pregenerated character. The GM will also pass around a sign-in sheet to record your character’s name, level, <a href="#factions">faction</a>, and Organized Play ID (if you don’t have an Organized Play ID yet, your GM can assign you one).  During this time, you also need to decide whether you are using <a href="#after-the-adventure-advancement-speed">Standard Advancement or Slow Advancement.</a>  (Slow advancement lets you play more scenarios with that same character before you reach the maximum level; standard advancement helps you level up and become powerful more quickly).</p>
<h2>During the Adventure</h2>
<p>In addition to the game rules in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, Pathfinder Society Organized Play has several additional rules for gameplay. These are the two most important.</p>
<h3>One Character per Adventure</h3>
<p>You can have as many active characters as you want in Pathfinder Society. However, you can play only one of your characters during a specific adventure. If a fourth character is needed to meet the minimum number of characters per table, the fourth character must be a pregenerated character. The GM can assign a player to play the pregenerated character as well as their own character, or the GM can allow the group as a whole to choose the pregenerated character’s actions.</p>
<h3>No Character-versus-Character Combat</h3>
<p>The motto of the Pathfinder Society is “Explore, report, cooperate.” In keeping with the “cooperate” theme, do not engage in character-versus-character conflict. Accidental friendly fire can happen (due to missed attack rolls or other factors), but players must obtain the consent of other players before deliberately including fellow PCs in damaging effects. In such cases, the damage dealer should offer to assist with necessary healing costs. This rule does not apply in situations where a character is not acting of their own free well, such as if they’re being mind-controlled by an NPC and forced to attack a fellow Pathfinder.</p>
<h2>After the Adventure</h2>
<p>Upon completing an adventure, you’ll receive a Chronicle sheet from the GM. This sheet is a reflection of your accomplishments and includes a recap of your adventure; a log of the Experience Points, treasure access, and wealth gained; and a special boon reflecting your experiences in the adventure. If you created your own character, this Chronicle sheet applies to that character, and you may wish to record the Experience Points you gained, the wealth you spent and earned, and items you bought on your character sheet. If you played a pregenerated character, this Chronicle sheet will apply to the first character you create.</p>
<p>As a player, you are expected to keep accurate, up-to-date records of your characters and bring your Chronicle sheets to every Pathfinder Society event or session. If you don’t bring your Chronicle sheets for a character, you will be unable to play that character, though you can play another character or a pregenerated character of an appropriate level instead. We suggest keeping everything in a binder with an individual folder for each character.</p>
<p>See <a href="#chronicle-sheets-and-record-keeping">Chronicle Sheets and Recordkeeping</a>  for information on filling out Chronicle sheets and <a href="#negative effects">Negative Effects</a> for how to resolve negative effects at the end of an adventure.</p>
<p>If you haven’t registered for organized play at <a href="https://paizo.com/"><strong>paizo.com</strong></a>, remember to do so now!</p>
<h3>Replaying Adventures</h3>
<p>Generally you can receive up to two Chronicle sheets for a given adventure, one for playing an adventure and one for running the same adventure as a GM. Some adventures have the “replayable” tag and can be replayed multiple times. For more information on replayable scenarios, see <a href="#replaying-adventures">Replaying Adventures</a>.</p>
<h3>Playtest Points</h3>
<p>If you already have points or boons accrued during a playtest, see <a href="#special-rewards">Special Rewards</a> for information on redeeming playtest points and using playtest boons.</p>

<p>Pathfinder Society, which is part of Paizo’s organized play program, is a worldwide fantasy roleplaying campaign that puts you in the role of an agent of the Pathfinder Society, a legendary league of explorers, archaeologists, and adventurers dedicated to discovering and chronicling the greatest mysteries and wonders of an ancient world beset by magic and evil. The campaign is set on the world of Golarion, and its home base is Absalom, the so-called City at the Center of the World, which stands astride the great Inner Sea on the mountain-capped Isle of Kortos. A Pathfinder’s adventures range from exploring the dark alleys and political intrigues of Absalom to embarking on far-flung travels to the most exciting locales in the Lost Omens setting.</p>
<p>Pathfinder Society Organized Play uses Pathfinder Second Edition. This guide presents the information you need to participate in this exciting, dynamic campaign. Welcome to the Pathfinder Society!</p>
<p><span id="more-457"></span></p>
<h2>What Is Organized Play?</h2>
<p>In an organized play campaign, your character adventures in a shared setting with thousands of other gamers worldwide. Games can take place anywhere, including homes, game stores, libraries, conventions, and online. Afterward, participants report their adventures’ results, both earning campaign rewards and influencing the fate of the Lost Omens setting. As part of the organized play experience, you can take your characters to any Pathfinder Society event in the world, allowing you to join a game with friends and strangers alike with ease. And after each adventure, your characters grow stronger and can carry their rewards with them to the next adventure, even if your fellow players and Game Masters (GMs) change between adventures. The organized play experience is uniquely immersive, as the diverse range of players, GMs, and characters provide incredible depth. The campaign is also a great way to meet other gamers and play regularly without needing to schedule regular events with a single set of people as you might for a more traditional game.</p>
<p>In order to help the Pathfinder Society program function smoothly in a shared-world environment, the campaign has some additional rules to ensure a fair and equal experience for all participants—no matter who is playing or running the game. The rest of this guide covers that information.</p>
<p>Paizo’s organized play team oversees the campaign’s content, and team members include the Organized Play manager, the Organized Play lead developer, Pathfinder Society developers, and the Pathfinder Society design liaison. Volunteers called <a href="#vol">Venture-Officers</a> facilitate the campaign by coordinating games worldwide.</p>
<p>Please read over the <a href="#qsg">Quick Start Guide</a>, which provides an overview of the campaign and character creation. Review the rest of this Guide for more details. If you have questions, direct them to the Organized Play manager at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com"><strong>organizedplay@paizo.com</strong></a>.</p>
<h2 id="scenario-tags">Scenario Tags</h2>
<p>Tags are markers that appear both on a scenario’s product page and on its title page that gives key information about the scenario’s contents.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Scenarios with this tag are meant to be run in a specific environment or by a particular cadre of Pathfinder GMs. Common recipients of these sorts of scenarios include distinguished volunteers who’ve run many sessions of Pathfinder Society, GMs running an exclusive scenario at a large convention, or a Paizo staff member. Scenarios with this tag include specific rules on who is eligible to run it, where it may be run, and any other considerations for eligibility of receiving credit.</p>
<p><strong>Faction:</strong> Scenarios with this tag list one or more associated factions—for example, “Faction (Envoy’s Alliance).” This tag generally corresponds to scenarios with additional Reputation awards for the associated factions.</p>
<p><strong>Glyph:</strong> Scenarios with this tag contribute toward one of the ways that GMs can earn 5 Glyphs. (See <a href="#gm-glyph-rewards">GM Glyphs</a> )</p>
<p><strong id="tag-repeatable">Repeatable:</strong> Scenarios with this tag can be replayed an unlimited number of times (but only once per character). GMs receive another Chronicle sheet each time they run a scenario with this tag, but can apply credit only once to a given character.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-adventures">Types of Adventures</h2>
<p>Numerous types of adventures are used in the Pathfinder Society campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder Society Quests:</strong> These are short adventures written for Pathfinder Society and intended to take about 1 hour to play.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder Society Scenarios:</strong> These are the most common adventure type written for Pathfinder Society, and they typically take about 4–5 hours to complete.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder Adventure Paths:</strong> These are long campaigns consisting of multiple adventure volumes and often representing dozens of game sessions to complete. Adventure Paths are published for a wider audience than the Pathfinder Society campaign, so such adventures often include a short, downloadable sanctioning document that details any special considerations for running the adventure for organized play, as well as Chronicle sheets for the individual volumes. Adventure Paths often offer the opportunity to experience them in Campaign Mode, which does not use Pathfinder Society rules, allows the GM to freely modify the encounters and story, and still awards a Chronicle sheet afterward.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder Adventures:</strong> These are large, stand-alone adventure books that typically take numerous game sessions to complete. Like Adventure Paths, Pathfinder Adventures are designed for a wider audience and thus typically receive a short sanctioning document that can be downloaded from the adventure’s product page soon after its publication.</p>
<h2>Tiers and Subtiers</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Society Scenarios are designed so that players of a variety of levels can participate in a given adventure together. Every scenario has a tier range and many have associated subtiers. For example, a Tier 1–4 scenario has subtiers 1–2 and 3–4. Tiers indicate which character levels are legal for that scenario. If a PC’s level does not fall within the tier, that character cannot play in that scenario.</p>
<p>In the future, some special events will have more than two subtiers. For scenarios with more than two subtiers, no two PCs at a table can be from more that 1 subtier apart. For example, in a Tier 1–6 scenario, with Subtiers 1–2, 3–4, and 5–6, PCs of levels 1–4 can play together, and PCs of levels 3–6 can play together, but a level 1 character and a level 6 character cannot play together at the same table, since challenges that are appropriate for 5th- and 6th-level PCs are likely to leave the 1st-level PC ineffectual at best, if not kill the character outright.</p>
<h2>Legal Table Size</h2>
<p>The minimum table size for a Pathfinder Society session is four players. The recommended maximum is six players. In cases where you simply cannot seat four players, the GM can run a table of three players, and can play an appropriately leveled pregenerated iconic character (or deputize players to do so) in order to meet the minimum table size of four PCs. Pregenerated iconic characters are available for 1st level and 5th level. Pregenerated characters of more levels will be available in the future.</p>
<p>If seven players show up to an event, rather than turning someone away, the GM can consider adding a seventh person to the table. She should check with the players to determine their preferences before running a seven-person table, as seven-person tables often overpower otherwise challenging adventures and limit the amount of time each player gets to shine in the given scenario.</p>
<p>Tables may not have eight or more players. If eight players show up to an event and there is more table space, see if one of the players can GM a game instead.</p>
<h2>Before the Adventure</h2>
<p>As you sit down to join a game, take time to introduce yourself and determine which of your characters in the adventure’s tier you wish to play. The GM should pass around a sign-in sheet, on which you should record basic information such as your character’s name, your Organized Play ID, your character’s ID number, their level, and their chosen faction. During this time, you also need to decide whether you are using <a href="#after-the-adventure-advancement-speed">Standard Advancement or Slow Advancement.</a></p>
<h2 id="hero-points">Hero Points</h2>
<p>At the beginning of an adventure, each player receives 1 Hero Point. GMs can then hand out additional Hero Points throughout the session in recognition of the characters’ deeds, at a rate of approximately 1 Hero Point per hour of play. When handing out Hero Points, try to spread them out throughout the table rather than giving most of the points to one player.</p>
<p>Players who have earned GM glyphs can hand out one additional hero point per Glyph at the start of the adventure when boons are slotted.  But no player can receive more than 1 hero point this way per adventure.  See <a href="#gm-glyph-rewards">GM Glyph Rewards</a></p>
<h2>One Character per Adventure</h2>
<p>You can have as many active characters as you want in Pathfinder Society. However, you can play only one of your characters during a specific adventure. If a fourth character is needed to meet the minimum number of characters per table, the fourth character must be a pregenerated character. The GM can assign a player to play the pregenerated character as well as their own character, or the GM can allow the group as a whole to choose the pregenerated character’s actions.</p>
<h2 id="replaying-adventures">Replaying Adventures</h2>
<p>Most scenarios are designed to be played once. You can receive a Chronicle sheet for a given adventure twice: once for playing the adventure and once for running the adventure as a GM—even if you run the adventure multiple times, though each time you GM an adventure contributes to your GM glyph rating and rewards. The following are the several exceptions in which a player can replay an adventure (or a GM can receive a Chronicle sheet more than once).</p>
<p><strong>Glyph Replay (player and GM):</strong> A campaign participant who has received one or more GM glyphs as a result of running adventures can earn credit for an adventure an additional time, either as a player or as a GM. A participant can replay one such adventure per glyph earned. Future rewards could allow participants to use their earned glyphs additional times to replay in this way.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Table Size (player):</strong> You can replay an adventure in order to help a group reach the minimum legal table size of three players.</p>
<p><em>Notify the GM:</em> Inform the GM that you have already played the adventure or run it as a GM. Although a GM should endeavor to be flexible when accommodating you in order to form a table of at least three players, the GM maintains the right to deny running the adventure for you if they feel uncomfortable running the event for players who have foreknowledge of the story.</p>
<p><em>No Spoilers:</em> When you are replaying an adventure, avoid spoiling the adventure’s plot or using insider information to affect gameplay. Doing so can be grounds for the GM to remove you from the table. In general, be mindful in separating player knowledge from character knowledge, and if you are uncertain how to proceed, speak privately with the GM to determine the best course of action.</p>
<p><em>Rewards:</em> When you replay to help create a legal table, you do not earn any rewards. The GM should provide you a Chronicle sheet that grants no rewards (including gold pieces, Experience Points, Fame, Reputation, and boons). However, do record any items expended or gold spent on the Chronicle sheet. This is an exception to the restriction that you should never assign more than one copy of a Chronicle sheet to a given character.</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable Tag (player and GM):</strong> Some adventure have the Repeatable tag, which indicates that adventure grants a Chronicle sheet and rewards each time it is played or run. However, a particular character still can’t receive credit from a given repeatable scenario more than once.</p>
<h2 id="special-rewards">Special Rewards</h2>
<p>The campaign awards several different rewards to players and GMs for participating in the various Pathfinder Society programs.</p>
<p><strong id="special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Points:</strong> By playing, running, and reporting Pathfinder Society games, participants earn Achievement Points (abbreviated ACP), a special online currency with which they can purchase special rewards like access to uncommon ancestries, items, spells, and more. The number of points depends on the size of the adventure and the event where it’s played. Standard events include games played in private residences and many public venues. Premier events include many conventions and special events designated by the Regional Venture-Coordinator. Premier Plus events include special shows (such as the Gen Con, Origins, and PaizoCon conventions) where Pathfinder Society has a special presence and often debuts major adventures.</p>

When you purchase a reward, you will need to assign the boon to one of your PCs, and the granted boon will auto-fill the special Chronicle sheet with your organized play number and your character’s number.</p>
<p><strong>Playtest Points (playtest adventures):</strong> During the playtest period for Pathfinder Second Edition, players and GMs did not earn Chronicle sheets when playing the 11 playtest adventures. Instead, each participant earned a number of Playtest Points, which can now be redeemed on your <a href="https://paizo.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Store.woa/wa/browse?path=organizedPlay/myAccount/rewards#tabs">Organized Play account at Paizo.</a> These rewards include Limited-Use boons, the ability to start a character at 2nd or 3rd level to reflect the time spent playing the game, and other minor benefits.</p>
<p>Because the playtest period has since closed, it is not currently possible to earn additional Playtest Points.</p>
<p><strong>Legacy Backgrounds (legacy campaign):</strong> Even though characters from the First Edition legacy campaign cannot transfer into the current Pathfinder Society campaign, their exploits can shape the Society’s newest adventurers. For each of the 11 seasons of the legacy campaign, a player can unlock a special legacy character background associated with that season by having completed five or more of that season’s scenarios. These backgrounds are unique to the Pathfinder Society campaign, and once they’re unlocked, a player use a legacy background for any number of characters. See <a href="#legback">Legacy Backgrounds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Other Rewards:</strong> Pathfinder Society Organized Play periodically releases additional prizes for special events. The most common among these are charity prizes, which are in-game benefits sent to authorized charity events to help raise money for good causes.</p>
<h2 id="after-the-adventure">After the Adventure</h2>
<p>Once you’ve completed a Pathfinder Society adventure, you receive a Chronicle sheet that tracks your accomplishments and rewards. The following steps summarize what information appears on a Chronicle sheet and how it impacts your character.</p>
<h3 id="after-the-adventure-advancement-speed">Advancement Speed</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Society characters can choose between two different advancement speeds, allowing them to gain levels and rewards more quickly or to slow down their advancement (such as to extend their character’s career or allow new players to catch up). It is entirely possible for different PCs at a table to use different advancement speeds with no impact on the game. At the beginning of the adventure, you choose which of the two advancement speeds to use.</p>
<p><strong>Standard Advancement:</strong> You gain the full XP, gp, Downtime, Fame, and Reputation rewards earned in the adventure.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Advancement:</strong> You gain half of the XP, gp, Downtime, Fame, and Reputation rewards earned in the adventure.</p>
<h3>Experience Points</h3>
<p>Each time you play an adventure, your character will gain Experience Points (XP). Typically, you gain 1 XP for completing a quest, 4 XP for completing a scenario, or even 12 XP for completing most sanctioned Pathfinder Adventure or Adventure Path volumes. For every 12 XP your character earns, they advance 1 level. You cannot delay increasing your character’s level once they earn the requisite number of XP.</p>
<h3 id="fame-and-reputation">Fame and Reputation</h3>
<p>In each adventure, the PCs can increase their personal renown as well as their standing with a faction, represented by Fame and Reputation. Fame is a form of social currency, allowing your character to call in favors and support. Reputation is a measure of how influential your character is with a particular faction, and higher scores open up new and more powerful ways that the faction can help you. Your character has a different Reputation score for each faction.</p>
<p>How much Fame and Reputation your character earns in an adventure depends on how well you fulfilled the adventure’s primary objectives and secondary objectives. The primary objectives usually represent the main mission that a venture-captain or other influential NPC imparted to the PCs. The secondary objectives might be explicitly stated in a briefing, or they might include opportunities that the PCs can uncover during play. secondary objectives often involve going above and beyond the adventure’s primary objectives (such as recovering all three of the relics, not just the minimum two), strengthening the Society’s status with an important group, acting with professionalism, or completing the main mission without causing undue damage to important sites.</p>
<p>A quest can grant up to 1 Fame and 1 Reputation. A scenario can grant up to 4 Fame and 4 Reputation, though scenarios with the Faction tag typically have an opportunity to gain additional Reputation with the associated faction. Sanctioned Pathfinder Adventures and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes typically grant up to 12 Fame and 12 Reputation.</p>
<h3 id="downtime">Downtime</h3>
<p>After each adventure, your character receives Downtime, which is a measure of their additional time between adventures. A quest grants 2 days of Downtime, a scenario grants 8 days, and a sanctioned Pathfinder Adventure or Adventure Path typically grants 24 days of Downtime. If your character is a <a href="#pathfinder-training-field-commissioned-agents">field-commissioned agent</a>  (rather than having trained with the <a href="#pathfinder-training">Scrolls, Spells, and Swords Pathfinder Schools</a> ), they earn an additional 50% as many days of Downtime, earning 3, 12, and 36 days respectively.</p>
<p>A character can use Downtime in a variety of ways, including the Crafting, Earn Income, and retraining options in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. Downtime must be spent at the end of the session or it expires; it cannot be stockpiled for later use. (See <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>.) However, players can spend their Downtime to start or continue an activity such as Crafting an item that requires multiple adventures’ worth of Downtime to complete.</p>
<h3>Treasure</h3>
<p>Unlike a traditional game in which the PCs would divide recovered magic items and other treasure among themselves, Pathfinder Society awards each participating PC a share of gold pieces based on their respective levels (see <a href="#treasure-bundles">Treasure Bundles</a>). Rather than divide up the magic items unequally, PCs have equal access to the special treasure found, represented by the items listed on the Chronicle sheet; simply purchase the item using your PC’s accumulated gold. At the end of the adventure, the GM crosses out any items the PCs did not discover.</p>
<h3 id="purchasing-guidelines">Purchasing Guidelines</h3>
<p>You can always purchase the following items so long as you’re in a settlement of at least 5,000 residents (and scenarios may sometimes provide additional allowances or limitations):</p>
<ul><li>Any common equipment in sanctioned Pathfinder content with an item level equal to or less than your character’s level (minimum 2).</li>
<li>Any uncommon equipment in sanctioned Pathfinder content with an item level equal to or less than your character’s level (minimum 2); your character must have access to this uncommon equipment such as through meeting its Access condition.</li>
<li>Any equipment listed on your character’s Chronicle sheets with an item level equal to or less than your character’s level + 2. Some items found on Chronicle sheets are available for purchase only a limited number of times.</li>
<li>Any items and services purchased with Fame.</li>
</ul><p>Note that accumulating Infamy can reduce the character’s effective level when purchasing equipment (see <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</a>).</p>
<h2 id="chronicle-sheets-and-record-keeping">Chronicle Sheets and Record-Keeping</h2>
<p>After completing an adventure for Pathfinder Society, the players and the GM all receive Chronicle sheets. Chronicle sheets record what happened during the adventure, as well as the rewards that the characters earned, such as XP, gold, and Reputation. A character’s Chronicle sheets record everything that they do over the course of their career. Chronicle Sheets are a standardized way of tracking each characters’ progress that allows these characters to be played with many different GMs and events all across the world.</p>
<h3 id="filling-out-chronicle-sheet">Filling Out a Chronicle Sheet</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chronicle-Sheet-Reference.png"><img alt="Image of a Chronicle Sheet for reference" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-471" height="300" sizes="(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chronicle-Sheet-Reference-251x300.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chronicle-Sheet-Reference-251x300.png 251w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chronicle-Sheet-Reference-768x919.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Chronicle-Sheet-Reference-856x1024.png 856w" width="251"/></a></p>
<p>The sections of a Chronicle sheet are detailed below. Sections marked with an asterisk (*) include some element that GMs must address before players leave the table, either by filling it in themselves or asking the players to fill in the appropriate information. Players can fill out other sections between sessions. More information on the player rewards references in this section appears in Player Rewards XXPlayer Basics&lt;Player Rewards.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;"><li><strong>Character Chronicle #:</strong> Players can use this section to number their Chronicle sheets as they see fit to help keep track of their adventures.</li>
<li><strong>Herolab Code:</strong> In the future, this code may allow for greater integration between your earned Chronicle sheets and the character builder program <a href="https://www.wolflair.com/hlo/">HeroLab</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Player Name*:</strong> The player’s name goes in this section.</li>
<li><strong>Character Name:</strong> The name of the character who receives credit for this adventure goes in this section.</li>
<li><strong>Organized Play # *:</strong> The player’s organized play number goes here. A player’s Organized Play ID is the same for Pathfinder Society, First Edition Pathfinder Society, Starfinder Society, and Pathfinder Adventure Card Society.</li>
<li><strong>Character # *:</strong> Character numbers for Pathfinder Society begin with 200-, followed by digits that represent the order in which the player registered the character (2001 for their first character, 2002 for their second, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Faction Reputation*:</strong> This section records the factions for which the character earned Reputation and how much reputation they earned.<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> Ask each player which faction that their character chose to champion this scenario. Note that some scenarios grant an additional Reputation for a specific faction. Fill out the earned reputation and the factions here.</li>
<li><strong>Adventure Summary*:</strong> This section gives a short summary of the adventure’s events.<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> Sometimes, this section will have checkboxes to represent player choices, which should be recorded before the players leave the table.</li>
<li><strong>Boons*:</strong> This section lists the special boons that the character earned, which they can use in future adventures.<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> The GM Resources section of the scenario describes how the players earn any boons listed on the Chronicle sheet. Cross off any boons the players did not earn.</li>
<li><strong>Items*:</strong> Characters gain access to the items listed in this section with a level up to their character level +2, as long as they have not acquired infamy (see <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</a>).<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> Cross off any items that the players did not earn during the scenario. Unless the GM Resources section says otherwise, players only lose access to an item if they did not earn the treasure bundle that corresponds to that item.</li>
<li><strong>Purchases*:</strong> This section records the items that characters buy and sell, as well as conditions that they gain or clear. Players are free to purchase and sell items between sessions. If your character purchases or sells enough items that you run out of space on the Chronicle sheet, you can continue the list on the back of the Chronicle sheet, or simply list everything on the back and write the total value in the box.<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> If the character gained or cleared any conditions that would otherwise persist into the next adventure, note them in these sections.</li>
<li><strong>Rewards*:</strong> This section tracks the rewards that the PC earns during the session and totals up the rewards they have at the end of the session. Players can do the calculations between sessions, as long as their new earnings are recorded.<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> Fill out the XP gained, GP gained, Earn Income, Gold Earned, and Fame Earned boxes before the end of the session.</li>
<li><strong>Notes:</strong> This section is a catch-all for anything that players or GMs want to record that isn’t already accounted for on the Chronicle sheet.</li>
<li><strong>Downtime*:</strong> Use this section to record how much Downtime your character earned from the adventure and how you spent it.<em><br/>
GM Instructions: </em>Be sure to resolve any Downtime activity that requires a check before the players leave the table. If the player is using an activity that does not require a check, they can record what they are doing and take time between sessions to make the decisions needed to resolve the effect fully. For example, players who want to retrain a feat can record that they are retraining a particular feat, and then decide which new feat they want to take between sessions.</li>
<li><strong>GM Information:</strong> The event name and event code in this section come from the event’s page on paizo.com. If you are reporting your own events, you may already know this information. If someone else organized the event, they should provide you with these details. This section also includes the date of the scenario and the GM’s organized play number and signature.<br/><em>GM Instructions:</em> Fill in each of these sections. While you can choose to let your players fill out any of the other information on this sheet at your discretion, only you can provide your signature.</li>
</ol><h2 id="community-standards">Community Standards</h2>
<p>The Pathfinder Society is an inclusive social event open to everyone. It is our intention that everybody enjoys gaming in a safe and fun environment. While conflict between characters may arise, at no time should a player feel excluded or threatened at the table. We ask all participants to respect their fellow players and to work together to create positive, memorable experiences. To this end, we reserve the right to refuse participation to any person for inappropriate or illegal conduct. All refusals of participation must be accompanied by a reason, duration of refusal, and the criteria for rejoining Pathfinder Society activities.</p>
<p>Inappropriate conduct includes, but is not limited to, the excessive use of foul language, physical or verbal aggression or intimidation, lewd conduct, inappropriate physical contact, unwelcome sexual attention, slander, stalking, and harassment or discrimination based on gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion.</p>
<p>Complaints under this policy should be brought to the Event Organizer or a Venture-Officer, who will work to resolve the issue or escalate the issue to the next level of Venture-Officer. If you are unsatisfied with the ability of Venture-Officers to resolve an issue, or if a Venture-Officer is involved in the issue, you can escalate the issue to a higher level yourself. As an alternative, you can report to the Organized Play manager (OPM) via e-mail at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com"><strong>organizedplay@paizo.com</strong></a>. Issues will be resolved at the lowest level possible. In case of escalation, the OPM is the final arbiter of any dispute arising from applying this policy.</p>
<p>Nothing in this policy is intended to discourage any person from calling the police or other appropriate organizations. Event organizers or Venture-Officers are available to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>While not illegal or even necessarily inappropriate, we recognize that Pathfinder Society organized play campaign includes themes that may result in uncomfortable situations arising at the gaming table. In these instances, we request players identify the issue to the table Game Master (GM), whether vocally or by passing a note. We ask that GMs help the table respect attendees’ sensibilities and reduce or redirect problematic themes once identified. Participants asked to stop any problematic behavior are expected to comply immediately or will be asked to leave the table. More guidance for GMs to resolve these situations appears in <a href="#table-variation">Table Variation</a></p>
<p>It is our intention that everybody participating in Pathfinder Society organized play enjoys gaming in a safe and fun environment. While conflict between characters may arise, at no time should a player feel excluded or threatened at the table. We ask all participants to respect their fellow players and to work together to create positive memorable experiences. The above guidelines reference how we may achieve our goals. By sitting at a Pathfinder Society table, participants are agreeing to the terms and conditions of Pathfinder Society organized play.</p>
<h3>Do Not Cheat</h3>
<p>Maintain the integrity of the game and do not cheat. This includes, but is not limited to, falsifying rolls, altering Chronicle sheets, using unapproved resources, not owning the sources used by your character, and lying to GMs and event coordinators. Participants caught cheating will be barred from Pathfinder Society events for an amount of time dependent on the severity of the cheating. Repeat offenders will be banned from Pathfinder Society and Paizo’s other organized play programs.</p>
<h3>Keep Good Records</h3>
<p>Pathfinder Society uses character sheets and Chronicle sheets to track character progression. GMs and event coordinators rely on these documents to keep the campaign honest, fair, and fun for everyone. It is your responsibility to maintain accurate records. Always bring either paper or digital copies of your character sheet and all accompanying Chronicle sheets of any character you wish to play to Pathfinder Society events. If using paper copies, we suggest keeping them all together in a binder, with a folder for each character.</p>
<h2>No Character-versus-Character Combat</h2>
<p>The motto of the Pathfinder Society is “Explore, report, cooperate.” In keeping with the “cooperate” theme, do not engage in character-versus-character conflict. Accidental friendly fire can happen (due to missed attack rolls or other factors), but players must obtain the consent of other players before deliberately including fellow PCs in damaging effects. In such cases, the damage dealer should offer to assist with necessary healing costs. This rule does not apply in situations where a character is not acting of their own free well, such as if they’re being mind-controlled by an NPC and forced to attack a fellow Pathfinder.</p>
<h2>Implementing Changes</h2>
<p>Sometimes, whether through errata or campaign clarifications, rules changes are made just before a convention, game day, or other gaming event. In such situations, if the player does not have the time or the access to resources to fix their character, they can wait to apply the changes until after the event. GMs should make a note of this delay in the notes section of the Chronicle sheet. Players must update their characters after the event</p>

		<a name="wopf"><h1>World of Pathfinder Society  </h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
		
<p>The world of Pathfinder and of Pathfinder Society is a world called Golarion. The Age of Lost Omens below provides a basic introduction to the setting; you can learn more about Golarion from Chapter 8 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, from upcoming Lost Omens setting books, and from the <a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/">Pathfinder Wiki</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-473"></span></p>
<h2 id="pathfinder-society">What Is The Pathfinder Society?</h2>
<p>Your character is a member of an in-game organization known as the Pathfinder Society. Pathfinder agents are adventurers who travel throughout the world, exploring new places and chronicling both history and modern lore. The most significant and exciting Pathfinder missions earn a spot in the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>, an ongoing series of journals that are copied and spread far and wide to share the Society’s discoveries with the world. Pathfinders agents come from all over the world and from all walks of life; anyone willing to work together with other agents to pursue the Society’s aims is welcome to try to join the organization. Together, these tenets are captured in the Pathfinder motto: “Explore, report, cooperate.”</p>
<h3 id="pathfinder-society-training">Training</h3>
<p>Most prospective Pathfinders start their careers by traveling to the Society’s headquarters, the Grand Lodge, to receive training. This training program ensures that new agents are equipped with the skills they need to handle perilous situations, and that they are well-versed in the art of working together as a team. The training program is organized into the three Pathfinder Schools: the Spells, the Scrolls, and the Swords. The Spells, overseen by Master of Spells Sorrina Westyr, trains agents in matters concerning magic, from honing their own abilities to cast spells and rituals to teaching them how to recognize and counter spellwork that they may find in the field. The Scrolls focuses on scholarship and study, teaching agents a wide array of useful knowledge from any discipline that intrigues them, including how to properly document their discoveries. Finally, the Swords gives agents physical training, helping them improve their martial prowess and teaching them survival skills, from disarming traps and sneaking to climbing and swimming. Newly appointed Head Initiate Janira Gavix helps trainees thrive during their education and during their first few years as full agents.</p>
<p>A rare few Pathfinders skip the usual training process, having already distinguished themselves in some way that proves that they have what it takes to be a Pathfinder. These agents receive field commissions, which allow them to engage in a far shorter training process. Field commissioned agents have fewer responsibilities back at the Grand Lodge, but they also tend to receive less material support from the Pathfinder Society than agents who built connections there during their years of practice and study. Once an agent has completed their training, they have the freedom to travel the world and seek out places to explore.</p>
<h3 id="pathfinder-society-leadership">Leadership</h3>
<p>Most Pathfinder missions are assigned by a group of leaders known as venture-captains. Venture-captains typically spend a lot less time in the field than adventuring agents, instead spending their time managing a lodge. In the process, venture-captains watch for leads for suitable missions, handle logistics and paperwork, and scout out nearby Pathfinders who may be interested in the adventure opportunities they have to offer.  At the top of the Pathfinder Society’s hierarchy are the Decemvirate, also known as the Ten. Most of the members of The Ten hide their identities behind magical masks, but recent rumors indicate that one of the Ten has decided to go public with her identity.</p>
<h3 id="pathfinder-society-symbols">Symbols</h3>
<p>The official symbol of the Pathfinder Society is the glyph of the open road, a symbol depicting a stylized intersection of two roads under a star. Most Pathfinders carry a special type of magical compass known as a <em>wayfinder</em>; because these compasses are hard to find outside of the Society, they serve as badges of membership.</p>

<p>This guide is for players who are already registered for organized play and have played through their first game.</p>
<p><span id="more-459"></span></p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>In Pathfinder Society games, you can either use a pregenerated character or create your own character.</p>
<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
<p>The process of creating a character follows the guidelines in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, with a few additional campaign-specific benefits. <a href="#character-creation">Character Creation</a> contains step-by-step instructions to help you create your own Pathfinder Society character and explains the aforementioned benefits. Read these rules carefully, as they ensure that characters are suitable for the organized play campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> All of the ancestries, backgrounds, and classes from the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> are available to you when creating a character. Some ancestries and options from other books may need to be accessed with <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Points</a> before you can use them in organized play. (See also <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.)</p>
<p>Remember to <a href="#register">register your character</a>  at <a href="https://paizo.com/"><strong>paizo.com</strong></a>!</p>
<h3 id="pregenerated-characters">Pregenerated Characters</h3>
<p>If you don’t have time to create a new character or want to try out a new character class, you can use a pregenerated character, also called a pregen. The Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild offers free pregenerated characters based on Pathfinder’s iconic characters, available at <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">paizo.com</a> or from your local event coordinator.  The following rules apply when playing pregenerated characters.</p>
<h4>Choose a Character to Receive Credit</h4>
<p>Before the game, you must choose which of your characters to assign the credit for playing this adventure to. (If you haven’t created your own character yet, you’ll assign it to the first character that you create.) Credit from a 1st-level pregenerated character can be assigned only to a 1st-level character. Credit for playing a higher-level pregenerated character must be assigned to a Pathfinder Society character of a lower level than the pregenerated character.</p>
<h4>Negative Effects</h4>
<p>During play, your pregenerated character may be afflicted with negative effects such as a curse, a disease, or even death. The pregenerated character must clear and resolve these negative effects before the end of the adventure; otherwise, they affect the Pathfinder Society character that’s receiving credit for the adventure. A few adventures, such as <em>Origins of the Open Road</em>, have special rules for pregenerated characters that provide alternate means to clear negative effects.</p>
<ul><li>After applying Pathfinder Society character resources, you can use the pregenerated character’s funds to pay for these spellcasting services. If sold to pay for removing a negative effect, a 1st-level character’s gear is worth 7.5 gold pieces, a 3rd-level character’s gear is worth 37.5 gold pieces, and a 5th-level character’s gear is worth 135 gold pieces.</li>
<li>The character can use the gold and Fame that she has earned on the Chronicle sheet for the current adventure to help pay for removing negative effects.</li>
<li>If more resources are needed to pay for the cost of removing negative effects, players at the table can contribute some of their own gold pieces, but they are not required to.</li>
</ul><h4>Apply Credit</h4>
<p>You may apply a pregenerated character’s Chronicle sheet to one of your Pathfinder Society characters once your Pathfinder Society character reaches the level of the pregenerated character used to play through it. For example, if you played a 5th-level pregenerated character, you would apply the credit once your character reaches 5th level.</p>
<ul><li>Apply the Chronicle sheets for eligible adventures in the order in which they were played. For each one, add the rewards earned (Experience Points, gold pieces, Fame, boons etc.) to your character, along with any negative effects that weren’t removed from the pregenerated character. This character is also now able to buy any items listed on that Chronicle sheet.</li>
<li>If you apply credit for multiple adventures at once, your Pathfinder Society character might advance multiple levels. The character’s level cannot exceed the tier range of any Chronicle sheets applied to them.</li>
<li>You can apply credit from a higher-tier adventure to a 1st-level Pathfinder Society character. When doing so, you gain only the gold appropriate to a 1st-level character. You do not benefit from any boons until your Pathfinder Society character reaches the minimum level listed on the Chronicle sheet, unless otherwise noted.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Downtime: </strong>Pregenerated characters can use <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>.</p>
<h2>Before the Adventure Session</h2>
<p>At the game table, introduce yourself to the other players and the Game Master. Take this time to determine which character within the adventure’s subtier (range of levels) you want to play—this can be a character you created or a pregenerated character. The GM will also pass around a sign-in sheet to record your character’s name, level, <a href="#factions">faction</a>, and Organized Play ID (if you don’t have an Organized Play ID yet, your GM can assign you one).  During this time, you also need to decide whether you are using <a href="#after-the-adventure-advancement-speed">Standard Advancement or Slow Advancement.</a>  (Slow advancement lets you play more scenarios with that same character before you reach the maximum level; standard advancement helps you level up and become powerful more quickly).</p>
<h2 id="negative effects">Negative Effects</h2>
<p>The Pathfinder Society has resources to take care of its members, and many of the possible negative effects an adventurer can be subject to during an adventure are assumed to be taken care of during Downtime. The exceptions to this are death, permanent petrification or polymorph effects, curses, and permanent negative conditions (<em>Core Rulebook </em>618–623) acquired during the course of the adventure. These negative effects must be cleared at the end of the adventure or the character must be reported as “dead,” unable to continue adventuring in Pathfinder Society organized play. Most of these negative effects can be cleared by spending Fame for the appropriate service on <a href="#table-all-faction-boon">Table 2: All-Factions Boons</a>.  Other PCs may use their spells, feats, class abilities, or consumables to assist you in recovering from such negative effects, but they aren’t required to.</p>
<h2>Option Rarity and Access</h2>
<p>Some options within the game will have a listed rarity. The categories of rarity are common, uncommon, rare, and unique. Common options from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are always available for use. Uncommon options typically require a specific condition to be met to take them; this can include taking a specific feat or class feature, acquiring the item during a game and gaining it on a Chronicle sheet, or meeting another access condition (see below). Rare options are incredibly difficult to find or obtain and are generally not available for use in character creation or leveling. Unique options are the rarest of all, with only one existing in all the world, and will almost never be available as player options. Be sure to check Character Options for more information on the availability of options.</p>
<p><strong>Access: </strong>Some uncommon options have an entry labeled “Access.” If you satisfy the access condition by being from the specified region, a member of a particular organization, or meeting some similar requirement, that option is common for you. All characters created for use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play are members of the Pathfinder Society organization in the world of Golarion, so they gain access to options that require membership in the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Equipment</h3>
<p>As you complete adventures, you will gain more wealth that can be used to buy any common item that is no more than 2 levels higher than your current level. Uncommon items may be granted by Chronicle sheets or through other special boons. Characters with the appropriate crafting feats may also be able to obtain formulas for equipment that they can create during <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>.</p>
<h2>Leveling Up</h2>
<p>In Pathfinder Society, characters level up after ever 12 Experience Points earned, instead of every 1,000 Experience Points. Leveling up your character otherwise works normally.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<p>This page details the steps for creating a character for the Pathfinder Society. These steps mirror those in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> with a few additional Roleplaying Guild-specific rules and benefits.</p>
<ol><li>
<h3>Ability Scores</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Generate your Pathfinder Society character’s ability scores using the method detailed on page 20 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Your character may also take two additional ability flaws to gain one additional ability boost as described in the Voluntary Flaws sidebar on page 26 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<ol start="2"><li>
<h3>Ancestry</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Select your character’s ancestry. The ancestry choices offered in the <em>Core Rulebook </em>are always available. Other ancestries may available as <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Point</a> boons or through <a href="#chopt">Character Options.</a></p>
<ol start="3"><li>
<h3>Languages</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Your character gains some languages based on their ancestry, but might speak additional languages depending on their Intelligence or class. All Pathfinder Society characters are literate and speak Common.</p>
<h4>Cultural Languages</h4>
<p><strong>Human:</strong> Humans can speak Common, as well as any other modern human language associated with their ethnicity. Humans gain one additional common language or regional language of their choice. The cultural languages listed below (along with their associated ethnicities) are good choices.</p>

<p>A character with a high Intelligence score can select bonus languages from the list of modern human languages above or the bonus languages listed in the source for the character’s ancestry.</p>
<ol start="4"><li>
<h3>Background</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Once you’ve chosen your character’s ancestry, it’s time to select their background. All of the backgrounds presented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> starting on page 60 are available for use. Other backgrounds will be available through the <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Point system</a>, or for completing scenarios in prior seasons of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign (See <a href="#legback">Legacy Backgrounds</a>). Backgrounds from other sources will generally be available so long as you own a valid copy of the source, though some exceptions may occur; these exceptions are noted in <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.</p>
<ol start="5"><li>
<h3>Class</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>All of the classes presented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are available to characters. Pathfinder Society characters begin at 1st level, though some boons available through the Achievement Point system may allow a character to start at 2nd or 3rd level.</p>
<ol start="6"><li>
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Your character’s Hit Points are determined by their ancestry, class, Constitution modifier, and level. Each ancestry gives a certain number of Hit Points, as detailed in its entry. This amount is added to the Hit Points granted by the character’s chosen class and their Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, a character gains the number of Hit Points specified in their class entry.</p>
<ol start="7"><li>
<h3>Skills</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Each class grants a starting proficiency ranks in certain skills at 1st level. Characters with a high Intelligence score are trained in a number of additional skills of their choice, as described in their class entry. Review Chapter 4 of the <em>Core Rulebook </em>for the details of how to assign skill increases and the benefits they grant.</p>
<ol start="8"><li>
<h3>Feats</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Each class grants feats starting at 1st level and at most or all levels thereafter. A character must be the same level as or a higher level than a feat to select it. There are four different types of feats a character gains: ancestry feats, class feats, general feats, and skill feats. Ancestry feats are determined by your ancestry and can be found in the same section as your other ancestry statistics. Class feats are your most powerful feats; they are determined by your character class and presented in the same section. General feats are feats that any character can take, and are located in Chapter 5 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> alongside Skill feats. Skill feats affect a skill in a particular way, usually giving the character more ways to use that skill; some skill feats are available only to characters whose proficiency rank in the skill is expert or greater.</p>
<p>Additional feats can be found in other books, as detailed in <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.</p>
<ol start="9"><li>
<h3>Starting Wealth and Equipment</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>All characters in Pathfinder Society begin with 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) that can be spent on starting gear. Chapter 6 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> has a wide array of useful starting gear. Page 289 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> includes class kits, prebuilt selections of gear tailored to each of the core classes. You can also spend your wealth to purchase any common item of your level or lower, including common items without a listed level.</p>
<ol start="10"><li>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Select one of the following alignments for your character (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 29): chaotic good, chaotic neutral, lawful good, lawful neutral, neutral, or neutral good. Players may not play evil characters. When choosing an alignment, be sure it satisfies any alignment requirements for your character’s class.</p>
<ol start="11"><li>
<h3>Religion</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Characters can worship any deity listed in the table of gods on page 437 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> or any other source listed in <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a> , so long as their alignment matches one of the deity’s listed follower alignments. Champions and clerics must choose a valid deity, though other classes can worship one of the faiths and philosophies presented on page 440 of <em>Core Rulebook</em> or another legal source. Characters can also be agnostic or atheist.</p>
<p>Some characters may revere deities they do not worship. Revering a deity means that your character may do things like wearing the deity’s holy symbol, attending the deity’s religious services, or performing other acts of obeisance that aren’t rewarded with spells or divine powers. For example, many druids revere Gozreh a deity of nature, but their primal magic is granted by Nature itself and does not come from Gozreh. A character may revere as many deities as they wish, but can worship and receive power from only one.</p>
<ol start="12"><li>
<h3>Age</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Characters must be at least young adults (see the Physical Description section for your selected ancestry in Chapter 2 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>), as particularly young characters can change the tone of some of the game’s threats.</p>
<ol start="13"><li>
<h3>Finishing Details</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Now it’s time to fine-tune your character’s appearance and personal history, including their region of origin,</p>
<p>preferred gender pronouns, and other particulars. Make a few notes on your character’s appearance that you can use to describe your character. Read through <a href="#wopf">The World of Pathfinder Society</a> for information on the campaign setting and consider using it to inform your character’s background.</p>
<p>You’ll also need a miniature or pawn to represent your character—Pathfinder uses a standard 1-inch grid to determine movement and tactical positioning in combat, so you need a physical representation of your character to use on the grid. Paizo produces a wide range of Pathfinder Pawns and also works with Reaper Miniatures and WizKids to offer a wide variety of gaming miniatures, so you can find just the right figure for your character.</p>
<ol start="14"><li>Pathfinder Training</li>
</ol><p>Each Pathfinder Society character receives 3 networking points to represent the connections they have made in the three <a href="#pathfinder-society-training">Pathfinder Schools</a>: Spells, Scrolls, or Swords. They can invest these points among the schools, or can forgo these points and instead be a “field commissioned agent.”  <wbr/>Each of these choices bestows different benefits as described below in <a href="#pathfinder-training">Pathfinder Training.</a></p>
<ol start="15"><li>
<h3>Factions</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Finally, choose a faction for your character to join. The factions represent different approaches to being a Pathfinder and priorities during missions. Joining a faction costs a boon, but your first such boon is free. Currently, four major factions and two minor factions are available.</p>
<h4>Major Factions</h4>
<p>The four main factions are summarized below. Detailed descriptions of these factions, as well as benefits of membership and faction goals, can be found in <a href="#factions">Factions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Envoy’s Alliance:</strong> Being a Pathfinder is dangerous work. Travel comes with its own dangers, traps seem to be everywhere, and just about everything seems ready to kill aspiring Pathfinder agents. Envoys’ Alliance aims to bolster the Society’s ranks and represent its members, making the Society ever stronger, better trained, and better supported.</p>
<p><strong>Grand Archive:</strong> Archaeology is a destructive science, and adventurers tend to be more destructive than most. If the Society is to uphold its mandate to study and preserve the past, then documentation and academic rigor are key. Yet members of the Grand Archive do not limit themselves to Absalom’s libraries; these bold explorers voyage to the most exciting sites to chronicle the past and share what they learn with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Horizon Hunters:</strong> The Horizon Hunters faction is home to those who carry on the proud tradition of ascending the highest peaks, plumbing the darkest depths, and seeing what lies over the next hill. And as sweet as it is to discover a lost ruin or unknown vista, it’s all the better to tell wild tales about the experience and revel in the admiration of peers—particularly if your deeds are immortalized in the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>, a widely distributed record of the greatest Pathfinders’ achievements and discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Vigilant Seal:</strong> While the Pathfinder Society’s motto is “Explore, Report, Cooperate”, members of the Vigilant Seal have their own three-part motto: “Protect, Contain, Destroy.” Members of the Vigilant Seal seek to ensure that ancient evils uncovered during their expeditions are properly dealt with—they protect ancient sites, contain possible threats, and destroy dangerous evils that can’t be safely contained.</p>
<h4>Minor Factions</h4>
<p>The two minor factions are summarized below. Detailed descriptions of the factions, as well as benefits of membership and faction goals, can be found in <a href="#factions">Factions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Radiant Oath:</strong> Pathfinders have a track record for thwarting evil, lending a helping hand, and presenting the Pathfinders as upstanding folk wherever they go. For the Radiant Oath, this benevolence extends beyond incidental assistance. Instead, the faction sees the Society’s broad reach as an excellent vector for assisting others the world over. Those who join the Radiant Oath swear simple vows to assist others, expanding on these promises the more they serve the faction.</p>
<p><strong>Verdant Wheel:</strong> Nature enthusiasts of all stripes—from grizzled trackers to bright-eyed ecologists to tenacious druids—gravitate to the Society for opportunities to witness natural wonders, catalog new species, and better protect the world’s pristine realms. The Verdant Wheel has a particular fondness for sensing patterns and cycles, such as that of creation and destruction, as exemplified by new growth sprouting from a fire-ravaged field. Yet even those intent on preserving that which exists can find a welcome home here.</p>
<h2 id="pathfinder-training">Pathfinder Training</h2>
<p>Although drawn from diverse backgrounds and regions, the vast majority of Pathfinders undergo approximately 3 years of training at the Grand Lodge, in the process learning the key skills they need to survive on the road, explore dangerous sites, and understand their discoveries. The deans of the Society’s three schools +oversee this training, each promoting particular techniques tied to their respective schools: the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords. <strong>Kreighton Shaine</strong> (CG male elf loremaster) is the Master of Scrolls, who instructs his pupils in history, languages, sciences, and academic esoterica. <strong>Sorrina Westyr</strong> (N female oread priest of Nethys) is the Master of Spells, who lectures on magical basics, overcoming supernatural hazards, and the proper handling of artifacts. And finally, <strong>Marcos Farabellus</strong> (CG male human commander) is the Master of Swords, who guides initiates through endurance drills, teaches the finer arts of infiltration, and ensures each Pathfinder has enough combat training to stay safe in dangerous lands.</p>
<p>Each Pathfinder initiate must attain a certain level of proficiency in all three schools’ teachings in order to graduate as a field agent, yet most specialize in one of the schools’ curricula and build life-long professional contacts with like-minded scholars. Over the course of their career, a Pathfinder regularly receives gifts from colleagues in the form of potions, scrolls, experimental alchemy, and more—in practice, this provides PCs one or more consumable items at the beginning of each scenario. In return, the field agent’s expected to return the favor by contributing labor, teaching expertise, lab assistance, or more between missions, reinforcing these professional relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Consumable Items:</strong> The universal benefit of this training is creating a network of colleagues and contacts who regularly provide you consumable items. At the beginning of each adventure, your character receives a consumable item of their level or lower from a list of options; they have access to the items of the appropriate level in <a href="#pathfinder-training-table-all-schools-items">Table 1: All-Schools Items</a> as well as the options on the tables for any of their chosen schools. If not used by the end of the adventure, the item is returned to the character’s contacts.</p>
<h3 id="pathfinder-training-assigning-points">Assigning Points</h3>
<p>When creating your character, you gain 3 networking points to distribute among the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords schools. These represent the amount of effort and attention your character dedicated to those schools while training as an initiate. Once assigned, these cannot be changed except through retraining (a process that takes 14 days to reassign all of the networking points and their associated benefits). The benefits you gain from each school depends on the number of networking points you invest in it, and the benefits are cumulative.</p>
<p><strong>1 Point:</strong> When selecting your free consumable item at the beginning of the adventure, you can choose one of the items on the school’s list of options.</p>
<p><strong>2 Points:</strong> You become trained in one of the Lore skills associated with that school, listed below. At 5th level, you gain a bonus skill feat selected from the list below.</p>
<p><em>Scrolls:</em> For the Lore skill, choose from Accounting Lore, Library Lore, or Scribing Lore. For the bonus skill feat, choose from Assurance, Automatic Knowledge, Multilingual, or Streetwise.</p>
<p><em>Spells:</em> For the Lore skill, choose from Academia Lore, Architecture Lore, or Herbalism Lore. For the bonus skill feat, choose from Arcane Sense, Assurance, Quick Identification, or Recognize Spell.</p>
<p><em>Swords:</em> For the Lore skill, choose from Gladiatorial Lore, Scouting Lore, or Warfare Lore. For the bonus skill feat, choose from Cat Fall, Experienced Smuggler, Forager, or Hefty Hauler.</p>
<p><strong>3 Points:</strong> When selecting your free consumable item at the beginning of the adventure, you gain both one item of your level or lower from the options available, and you gain a second item whose item level is no greater than half your level (minimum 1).</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h3 id="pathfinder-training-field-commissioned-agents">Field-Commissioned Agents</h3>
<p>Not everyone goes through this training. Exceptional explorers and scholars sometimes attract the Society’s attention through their independent accomplishments, and venture-captains have the authority to grant these adventurers field commissions. This waives the usual training period, but what the field-commissioned agents recoup in free time, they lose in networking opportunities.</p>
<p>If your character is a field-commissioned agent, they do not get any points to assign to a school. At the beginning of each adventure, the agent receives a consumable item of half their level or lower from Table XX: All Schools; at 1st level, the character does not receive any such consumable items. However, the character’s fewer obligations afford them additional free time, increasing the amount of Downtime they receive after each adventure by 50% (12 Downtime days earned after a scenario rather than 8).</p>
<h2>Rebuilding Your Character</h2>
<p>You may find that there are aspects of your character where you’re not entirely sure about your decisions, such as the ancestry or class feat you chose. Don’t worry! While your character is 1st level, you can rebuild as often as you need to, changing any of these choices. Until you play a game in which your character has 12 or more XP, you can freely rebuild your character completely except for Reputation earned and character number. Once you begin a session as a second level character, you still have options for changing your character’s choices. In addition to <a href="#downtime-retraining">retraining</a>, in which your character spends their Downtime to swap out individual features of their build, you can earn boons that allow you to rebuild your character more extensively.</p>
<h2 id="player-rewards">Player Rewards</h2>
<p>You can earn rewards from the adventures you play in and are Game Master for, as well as for other special circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="player-rewards-boons">Boons</h3>
<p>Boons are small in-game rewards given for a variety of reasons, including attendance at events, holidays, supporting charities, and special occasions. Some examples of boon types are listed in <a href="#boons-boon-slots">Boon Slots </a>below.</p>
<p><strong>Achievement Points: </strong>Typically, when a Pathfinder Society game you play is reported online, Achievement Points will be credited to your Paizo account that can be redeemed for special boons, such as new playable ancestries or access to rewards from a region other than the one you chose during character creation. (See <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Points</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Chronicle Sheet:</strong> Every Chronicle sheet includes a special boon that grants a benefit unique to the adventure or product that granted it. Chronicle sheet boons generally need to be slotted (declared active) before their benefits can be applied, though some boons are slotless and may be used as long as you have the physical copy of the Chronicle sheet present. See <a href="#boons-boon-slots"><strong>Boon Slots</strong></a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Discounts:</strong> Some boons provide a discount on the cost in Fame or gold pieces required to purchase another boon or item. Unless otherwise noted, only one boon that provides any discount can be applied to any one purchase. This prevents multiple discounts from reducing a purchase’s cost by an unreasonable amount.</p>
<h3 id="boons-boon-slots">Boon Slots</h3>
<p>Each character has five boon slots available to “slot” (declare active) and use the boons they have acquired. A character chooses which boons to slot after the GM complete the mission briefing for their adventure (or introduction in the case of some Pathfinder Adventures and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes). Three of these slots are generic and can be used to slot any kind of boon other than faction and advanced boons. Faction boons indicate the faction you have chosen to represent for this mission, which can impact the Fame you gain and possibly other elements of the scenario. Advanced boons are rare and powerful, and are typically gained through participation in a special event (such as a game with unique, hidden conditions or a special promotional event, like a playtest).</p>
<p><strong>Boon Traits:</strong> Many boons have one or more traits, some of which indicate the boon’s flavor and others which convey special rules for using the boon. Future rewards or effects may also interact with particular types of boons in special ways. The following are the current boon types:</p>
<ul><li>An <strong>advanced</strong> boon is typically more powerful or complex than other boons, and it can be slotted only in the advanced boon slot (not a generic boon slot). As a result, you can only use one advanced boon at a time.</li>
<li>An <strong>ally</strong> boon represents an NPC who accompanies and assists your character. Unless you choose to purposefully endanger that NPC (an act that might result in your gaining Infamy, depending on the circumstances) or an effect specifically targets an Ally boon, this NPC stays out of harm’s way, does not interfere with combat, and takes up no space during encounters.</li>
<li>A <strong>Downtime</strong> boon provides you some special way to use the Downtime you earn at the end of the adventure.</li>
<li>A <strong>faction</strong> boon indicates which faction you are representing during an adventure. You can slot a faction boon only in the faction slot (not in the generic or advanced slots).</li>
<li>A <strong>heroic</strong> boon influences how you use Hero Points or grants an additional effect when you use a Hero Point.</li>
<li>An <strong>item</strong> boon represents a special piece of equipment you’ve acquired or a special way that you’ve modified a piece of equipment you already have.</li>
<li>A <strong>limited-use</strong> boon can only be used a limited number of times before it is expended. Some boons have both a constant benefit as well as a benefit with limited uses, and the constant benefit can still be used once all of the boon’s limited uses have been expended.</li>
<li>A <strong>mentor</strong> boon grants a benefit to PCs whose level is lower than yours, representing your mentorship of your less experienced comrades.</li>
<li>A <strong>promotional</strong> boon represents a special benefit for bringing specific Pathfinder- or campaign-branded gear (like a Pathfinder Society shirt or a Campaign Service Award coin) with you to the gaming table. As a general rule, you can slot only a single promotional boon.</li>
<li>A <strong>property</strong> boon represents a building, large vehicle, or other asset that your character owns or can use.</li>
<li>A <strong>service</strong> boon represents an instantaneous, one-time favor or action performed for your character, after which the boon is expended and grants no further benefit.</li>
<li>A <strong>slotless</strong> boon does not need to be slotted to grant its effect. Some slotless boons modify existing boons you already have.</li>
<li>A <strong>social</strong> boon represents a special affiliation, membership, friendship, or favor.</li>
<li>A <strong>trial</strong> boon represents an ongoing difficulty that is difficult to end. A trial boon typically requires that you slot it before you can slot any other boons, and trial boons typically have a special condition you must fulfill to end them.</li>
</ul><h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2>
<p>Upon completing an adventure that grants XP, you gain days of Downtime that can be spent in a variety of ways. (See Organized Play Basics, under <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>, for how many days each type of adventure grants.)  These include attempting checks to Earn Income and Craft items, as well as retraining. Certain other activities may be available depending on boons or other circumstances as described in the adventure. Typically, once you have begun a Downtime task you cannot begin another until the first task is completed, though some exceptions exist (see <a href="#downtime-crafting">Crafting</a> and <a href="#downtime-retraining">Retraining</a> below). You can’t save up Downtime from multiple Chronicle sheets, but you can start or continue an activity such as Crafting an item that requires multiple adventures’ worth of Downtime to complete</p>
<p><strong id="downtime-earn-income">Earn Income: </strong>Earning Income is the most common Downtime activity. If you are using your Downtime for any other purposes, they must be completed first before you attempt your check to Earn Income. For each 8 day unit of Downtime you spend (including units where you complete multiple activities, such as spending 7 days retraining and then 1 day Earning Income), you attempt one check to Earn Income, using the result to calculate your total earnings for that block of Downtime. The Task Level of you Earn Income check is equal to your level – 2 (minimum 0) by default (GMs should check <strong>Table</strong> <strong>10–5: DCs by Level </strong>on page 503 of the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> to calculate the DC), though some boons may allow you to attempt checks against higher-level tasks as a special reward. A check to Earn Income does not carry beyond the 8-day cycle for which you attempt the check.</p>
<p><strong id="downtime-crafting">Crafting: </strong>Some characters may choose to spend their time Crafting a piece of equipment. This works as described on pages 503–504 the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Use the DC based on the level of the item from <strong>Table 10–5</strong> for common items, applying the hard DC adjustment from <strong>Table 10–6</strong> to the DC for uncommon items and the very hard DC adjustment for rare items. You can Craft uncommon or rare items only if you find their formulas. Crafting requires that you spend the first 4 days of a block of Downtime preparing before attempting your check to Craft; unlike Earning Income, Crafting tasks can be continued across as many Downtime days as necessary until the item is completed or you pay the remainder of the Price required to finish the item.</p>
<p><strong id="downtime-retraining">Retraining:</strong> You can also use Downtime to retrain certain abilities and swap them out for new ones. This works as described in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Retraining a feat, skill increase, or a spell in your spell repertoire takes 7 days of Downtime, while retraining a selectable class feature, such as a druid order, takes 28 days. If you level up when still in the process of retraining a selectable class feature such as a druid order, you may choose an option that would be legal for the new order you are retraining to, though you may not use that ability until the retraining is complete.</p>
<p>For example, suppose Lini is 5th level and has decided that she would prefer to return Droogami to the wild and master the arts of a storm order druid instead. She begins the retraining process but will not complete it until she has completed her first scenario as a 6th-level character; Lini may select the Storm Retribution feat as her 6th-level feat, but cannot use it until she completes her retraining and becomes a storm order druid. Similarly, any feats Lini has that were contingent on her previous order cease being functional once Lini has attained her new order; for example if Lini had chosen Mature Animal Companion as her 4th-level feat but no longer had the Animal Companion feat after retraining to become a storm order druid, the feat would simply be nonfunctional until she either gained an animal companion or retrained Mature Animal Companion for another feat.</p>
<p>You can also retrain your <a href="#pathfinder-training">Pathfinder training</a> —that is, your selection between Spells, Scrolls, Swords, or field-commissioned agent. Doing so takes 14 days of Downtime, during which you adjust your level of affiliation with these aspects of the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<h2>Experience Points</h2>
<p>Most adventures grant your character Experience Points (XP) for completing them. Whenever your character gains 12 XP, they reach a new level and gain additional benefits and abilities as described in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. Quests typically grant 1 XP, and scenarios typically grant 4. Sanctioned Pathfinder Adventures, Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes, and Pathfinder Modules volumes typically run much longer than a scenario and grant more XP; for example, a Chronicle sheet for a single Adventure Path volume is likely to grant 12 XP.</p>
<h2>Fame and Reputation</h2>
<p>Fame represents your standing within the Pathfinder Society. You accrue Fame every time you complete a quest, scenario, or other sanctioned adventure. You’ll accrue it at roughly the same pace as XP, though these two numbers will not necessarily be identical. Reputation measures your standing within a faction, and you can earn it by completing faction missions in certain scenarios. Reputation gives you access to different levels of <a href="#factionboons">faction rewards</a> , while Fame is primarily used for two purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing Faction Boons:</strong> You can use Fame to purchase <a href="#factionboons">boons</a>  from any factions with which you have Reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving Negative Effects:</strong> The Pathfinder Society has resources to take care of its members. To represent this, you can use Fame to resolve negative effects your character is suffering from, such as death, permanent petrification or polymorph effects, curses, and permanent negative conditions (<em>Core Rulebook </em>618–623). The Fame costs for the appropriate services are listed on <a href="#table-all-faction-boon">Table 2: All-Factions Boons</a>.</p>
<h2>Wealth</h2>
<p>Gold is the primary form of currency available to PCs for making purchases in-game. The gold you gain and spend during each adventure is tracked on that adventure’s Chronicle sheet.</p>
<h2>Hero Points</h2>
<p>In addition to the Hero Point you start each game with, the GM may award you Hero Points during play for particularly heroic deeds. You can spend Hero Points to reroll checks or even avoid death (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 467).</p>
<h2>Retail Incentive Program</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Society Organized Play rewards players who show their support by purchasing and using items featuring campaign insignia, faction logos, or Pathfinder branding. If you display any of the merchandise described above at the beginning of an adventure, your character gains one additional common consumable from their associated <a href="#pathfinder-training">Pathfinder School</a>(s) lists  (Spells, Swords, Scrolls, or All Schools) with a level no greater than half their character’s (minimum 1) for use during that adventure.</p>

<p>Running Pathfinder Society games is similar running a home campaign, but has some key differences. In addition to GM Basics, be sure to familiarize yourself with the contents of the <a href="#qsg">Quick Start Guide</a>, <a href="#opb">Organized Play Basics</a>, and <a href="#playbasic">Player Basics</a>. You need to know what players know, what their expectations are, and how their characters are created, played, and advanced.</p>
<p><span id="more-469"></span></p>
<h2>What Is A Game Master?</h2>
<p>A Game Master (GM) is the person who adjudicates the rules and controls all of the elements of the story and world that the players explore. A GM’s duty is to provide a fair and fun game. In Pathfinder Society, a GM has a few other duties, listed in Your Duties as a Game Master below.</p>
<h2>Who Can Be A Game Master?</h2>
<p>Anyone with a valid <a href="#qsg">Organized Play ID</a>  can run adventures in Pathfinder Society. There are no tests to qualify as a GM, nor are there feedback-based rating systems in which GMs are ranked by their players. While some players are hesitant to transition into the role of Game Master, local Pathfinder Society groups and the campaign as a whole benefit as the pool of Game Masters increases. In many cases, players sitting at a new GM’s table can offer guidance to help build that GM’s skills and confidence, so don’t be afraid to give it a try and give a whole table of players a great Pathfinder Society experience.</p>
<h2>Where Can I Buy Adventures?</h2>
<p>All available adventures suitable for Pathfinder Society can be purchased at <a href="https://paizo.com/"><strong>paizo.com</strong></a>. Anyone can purchase an adventure pdf—all you need is a free <strong>paizo.com</strong> account. Scenarios are generally released during the last week of each month. At least two new scenarios are released each month, with additional OP-specific content released periodically throughout the year. Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes are produced monthly, and Pathfinder Adventures are published several times each year. (See <a href="#types-of-adventures">Types of Adventures</a> for more about these products.)</p>
<h2 id="event-coordinator">What is an Event Coordinator?</h2>
<p>An event coordinator is a person who organizes a Pathfinder Society event. This event can range in size from a single table in a home or game store to a large convention with hundreds of tables. GMs can also be event coordinators, and they often are—for example, a GM organizing and running their own table is also an event coordinator if it’s the only table.</p>
<h2 id="your-duties-as-game-master">Your Duties As Game Master</h2>
<p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the following duties.</p>
<ul><li>Work with the event coordinator to schedule an event for you to GM.</li>
<li>Prepare an adventure to offer to players, including gathering the necessary supplies such as maps, miniatures, and reference materials.</li>
<li>Welcome each player to the table and facilitate introductions, and provide a signup sheet to collect their character’s name, level, <a href="#factions">faction</a>, and Organized Play ID. If any players don’t have an Organized Play ID, you can obtain one for them from the event coordinator or you can download a set of 10 Organized Play ID numbers on the Create an Event page by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the page. Don’t forget to introduce yourself.</li>
<li>If time permits, spend a few minutes looking over each player’s character sheet and most recent Chronicle sheets for accuracy. If you find any egregious issues that you can’t easily work with the player to fix, the player will need to choose a different character without such errors or play a pregenerated character instead. (See <a href="#reviewing-chronicle-sheets">Reviewing Chronicle Sheets</a> below.)</li>
<li>Run the scenario as written and within the time constraints of the event.</li>
<li>Give each player an accurate Chronicle sheet for that scenario based on the listed adventure rewards (see <a href="#filling-out-chronicle-sheet">Filling Out a Chronicle Sheet</a>).</li>
<li>Complete the adventure’s reporting sheet or an alternate reporting sheet provided by your <a href="#event-coordinator">event coordinator</a>. Turn the reporting sheet the event coordinator so that she can report the event at <strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong> in a timely fashion.</li>
</ul><h2 id="id=">Your Duties as an Event Coordinator</h2>
<p>The following duties are universal for event coordinators, regardless of the size of the event. If you are interested in being the primary organizer for a convention or other large event, contact your <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators">local Venture-Captain</a>  for more information.</p>
<ul><li>Select a time and location for your event. If the location is not your own home, either reserve space or ensure that your tables are welcome at the venue for the number of hours needed to run the type of adventures you plan to offer.</li>
<li>Choose what adventures will run at the event.</li>
<li>Gather GMs and players to fill up your tables. You can do this by word of mouth, forums, or tools like <a href="https://warhorn.net/"><strong>warhorn.net</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Register your event on paizo.com. First, log on to your <strong>paizo.com</strong> account. Then go to <a href="https://pathfindersociety.club/"><strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong></a> and click on Create an Event. Click the Create Your Event button near the bottom of the page. This will take your new event page. For each section of the page, click the edit button to open up text boxes to fill, enter the information that is relevant to your event and click save changes when you are done.</li>
<li>If you might have new players at your event, bring new Organized Play ID numbers for them. You can download a set of 10 Organized Play ID numbers on the Create an Event page by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of the page. If you need more than 10 Organized Play ID numbers for your event, email <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com"><strong>organizedplay@paizo.com</strong></a>. Alternatively, ask your GMs to bring their own new Organized Play ID numbers.</li>
<li>Bring a selection of <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">pregenerated characters</a> to your event, covering all of the character levels for that are appropriate to the adventures being offered. Alternatively, ask your GMs to bring their own pregenerated characters.</li>
<li>After the event, input the reporting data into the event on <strong>paizo.com</strong>. For this task, go back to the Create an Event page, find your event, and click the report button on the right side of the page. This will take you to a page that allows you to report the information for your event, one table at a time. Full instructions for using this reporting form appear at the top of the page. For large events, you may wish to share the reporting task. To enable other people to assist you with reporting event information, go back to your event page and enter their user names in the box below the Delegated Reporters header.</li>
</ul><h2 <built-in function id>="reviewing-chronicle-sheets">Reviewing Chronicle Sheets</h2>
<p>If time permits, GMs and coordinators should spend a few minutes reviewing players’ Chronicle sheets at the start of an event slot. These reviews can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, GMs may need to check to the Adventure Summary section to learn what your character did in a previous adventure, and GMs and coordinators can review Chronicle sheets to ensure that they are filled out correctly. These reviews can help ensure that players understand the rules of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder Society Campaign, as well as catch the errors that naturally crop up in the course of play. When reviewing a Chronicle sheet, if you notice anything that seems amiss, you can ask the player to explain any discrepancies to you. Remember that errors are far more likely to be honest mistakes than intentional cheating, and that it’s possible that they aren’t errors at all. And most errors turn out to be detrimental to characters, not to their advantage!</p>
<p>When you ask the player about a discrepancy, speak with the player calmly, nicely, and with an open mind. Resolve any issues as fairly as possible. For example, if the character selected an option that they did not have access to or that was not available to their character, let them pick another option instead. If they did not pay the full price for an item they have, they can pay for it in full, or, if they haven’t used it yet, simply remove the item from their character’s gear. If they paid too much for an item, refund them the extra they paid in the “items sold” section of their Chronicle sheet. Check with your event coordinator, Venture-Captain, or Venture-Lieutenant if you are unsure of how to fix a mistake, or if you and the player cannot come to an agreement about a fair resolution. Remember that the game is supposed to be fun, so waste as little time as possible on drama and spend as much time as possible providing an exciting, action-packed scenario for your players.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-points" style="page-break-before: always; page-break-inside: avoid;">Challenge Points</h2>
<p>In a typical home game, the PCs would all be the same level and face challenges tailored to their level. In an organized play environment, though, there needs to be more flexibility to make it easier for players whose characters are of different levels to participate in the same adventure.</p>
<p>To determine how to adjust an adventure to accommodate different character levels, Pathfinder Society uses a system called Challenge Points, in which you assign each PC a number of points based on their level and how it fits into the adventure tier, add up all of the PCs’ points, and compares the sum to a table. Based on the outcome, you’d use either the adventure’s lower or higher subtier, and it might apply a small bonus to the enemy creatures and check DCs to simulate a slightly higher-level adventure.</p>
<p>Some adventures have only one subtier. For these adventures, use the challenge point system to determine any adjustments. If the table would direct you to run the high subtier, instead run the adventure with the level bump and the 6-player adjustment.</p>
<p>In the future, some special scenarios will have more than two subtiers. When running such a scenario, pick two subtiers that are next to each other and that include all of your PCs, and determine the appropriate challenge based on that. For example, in the case of a Tier 1–6 adventure, you could either use subtiers 1–2 and 3–4 and determine difficulty as if it were a Tier 1–4 scenario or use subtiers 3–4 and 5–6 as if were a Tier 3–6 scenario. If all of your players are in the same subtier, then it does not matter which adjacent subtier you pick—the system will give you the same result.</p>
<h3>Calculating Challenge Points</h3>
<p>To calculate the number of Challenge Points the party represents, take the following steps.</p>
<p><strong>1: Record the PCs’ levels.</strong> The number of Challenge Points that each PC contributes is based only on their character levels.</p>
<p><strong>2: Convert the PCs’ levels to Challenge Points.</strong> and the number of Challenge Points a PC contributes depends on whether they are the lowest level in that tier, the second-lowest, the second-highest, or the highest level. Table 1 below notes how many Challenge Points each PC of a given level represents.</p>
<table class="table table-sm table-striped"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Character Level</strong></td>
<td><strong>Challenge Points</strong></td>
</tr><tr><td>Lowest</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr><tr><td>Second-Lowest</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr><tr><td>Second-Highest</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr><tr><td>Highest</td>
<td>6</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>For example, a 2nd-level PC in a Tier 1–4 adventure contributes 3 Challenge Points. A party of five PCs levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4 would contribute 2, 3, 4, 6, and 6 points respectively.</p>
<p><strong>3: Total the PCs’ Challenge Points.</strong> Add these values together to get a sum. In the above example of five PCs, the total number of Challenge Points is 21 (2+3+4+6+6).</p>
<p><strong>4: Compare the sum to Table 2: Calculating Subtier and Adjustments.</strong> Some of the subtier entries reference a 5- or 6-player adjustment, which appears in labeled sidebars in each adventure. Some subtier entries reference a level bump, which is a small boost to obstacles’ DCs and other numbers, as described in Applying Modifications below.</p>
<table class="table table-sm table-striped"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Total Points</strong></td>
<td><strong>Subtier</strong></td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>8–9</strong></td>
<td>Low subtier</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>10–11</strong></td>
<td>Low subtier (5-player adjustment)</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>12–13</strong></td>
<td>Low subtier (6-player adjustment)<br/>
OR Low subtier with level bump</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>14–15</strong></td>
<td>Low subtier (5-player adjustment with level bump to the adventure)</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>16–18</strong></td>
<td>High subtier</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>19–22</strong></td>
<td>High subtier (5-player adjustment)</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>23–27</strong></td>
<td>High subtier (6-player adjustment)<br/>
OR High subtier with level bump</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>28-32</strong></td>
<td>High subtier (5-player adjustment with level bump to the adventure)</td>
</tr><tr><td><strong>33–42</strong></td>
<td>High subtier (6-player adjustment with level bump to the adventure)</td>
</tr></tbody></table><p>Challenge Point totals of 12–13 and 23–27 allow the GM to make a choice between two options that provide a similar degree of challenge. However, each scenario varies slightly in the differences between these two options, and the GM is encouraged to select the option they predict will be a more fun and fair challenge for the group. (Parties often prefer options that give the PCs more monsters to fight.) You can pick between the options individually for each encounter.</p>
<p><strong>5: Apply a level bump to any PCs who have the lowest level within the tier(high subtier only).</strong> When a PC is several levels lower than the group’s appropriate subtier, the threats can seem insurmountable and overwhelming. When playing in the higher subtier, characters of the scenario’s minimum level (such as a 3rd-level PC playing in a Tier 3–6 scenario’s high subtier) gain a temporary boost called a level bump (see Applying Adjustments) to provide them a more fun and fair experience, representing the higher-level PCs’ mentorship and support.</p>
<p><strong>6: Apply the subtier and the adjustments.</strong> See Applying Modifications below for more details on using subtiers and applying various adjustments.</p>
<h3>Applying the Modifications</h3>
<p>Once you’ve determined the subtier and adjustments based on the group’s Challenge Point total, apply the proper modifications to the adventure to provide a fair challenge. These take five forms: subtier, player number, level bumps for adventures, and level bumps for PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Subtier:</strong> Nearly all encounters list two different sets of creature statistics, one for each of the two standard subtiers (ranges of levels the adventure is designed for). The adventure often also refers to important skill checks and saving throws in room descriptions or during events, listing one DC for the lower subtier and one for the higher subtier. In each of these cases, use the numbers, creatures, and other information listed for the selected subtier.</p>
<p><strong>Player Number:</strong> Scenarios and quests are designed for four players with ways to scale up the number or severity of threats to accommodate larger groups (referred to as the 5-player and 6-player adjustments), modeled off the Character Adjustment guidelines found on page 489 of the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. These adventures list adjustments appropriate for larger groups of PCs of equal level in special sidebars. The Challenge Point calculation may instruct the GM to apply one of these adjustments intended for larger groups (even if the group consists of only four PCs).</p>
<p><strong>Level Bump for Adventures:</strong> Scenarios and quests are designed to challenge PCs whose average level is the lower of the two levels in a given subtier (i.e., Subtier 1–2 is built to challenge 1st-level PCs, and Subtier 3–4 is built to challenge 3rd-level PCs). When the Challenge Point total determines that the group’s overall power is equivalent to the higher level in a subtier (e.g. 2nd level in Subtier 1–2), the GM applies a level bump to the entire adventure. Applying a level bump is a simple calculation:</p>
<ul><li>Increase every DC listed in the scenario by 1.</li>
<li>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers, Perception modifiers, and ACs of all enemy creatures by 1.</li>
<li>Increase the Hit Point totals of all enemy creatures by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.</li>
</ul><p>These straightforward adjustments make the adventure slightly more challenging for higher-level groups, though the adjustments cannot account for the more powerful abilities and spells that higher-level foes would likely have.</p>
<p><strong>Level Bump for PCs:</strong> When a PC of the lowest legal level for an adventure plays in the high subtier, they also gain the level bump benefits listed above for the duration of the adventure, but instead applied to their character’s Armor Class, DCs, modifiers, and Hit Points. These adjustments are less beneficial than gaining a level, yet they provide the PC more survivability and opportunity to contribute to the adventure experience, reducing the degree to which higher-level PCs might overshadow these less experienced Pathfinders.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Tonya is setting up a Tier 1–4 adventure. Her group consists of six players whose PCs are levels 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, and 4, giving her a Challenge Point total of 25. Table 2 tells Tonya to run Subtier 3–4, but she gets to decide whether to use the 6-player adjustment or the level bump. She chooses the 6-player adjustment because that option adds more enemy wererats to the adventure rather than making the wererats stronger, which she thinks will be more fun for the lower-level PCs.</p>
<p>For each DC and encounter, Tonya uses the Subtier 3–4 statistics. She also applies the 6-player adjustments listed in any sidebars in the adventure. Finally, she gives the 1st-level PC at her table a level bump, increasing that PC’s ability to contribute in this higher-level adventure.</p>
<h2 id="table-variation">Table Variation</h2>
<p>While the goal of the Pathfinder Society is to provide an even, balanced experience that is fair to all players, every table is different, every character is different, and each GM has their own strengths and weaknesses. We understand that sometimes a Game Master has to make rules adjudications on the fly, deal with unexpected player choices, or even cope with extremely unlucky (or lucky) dice on both sides of the screen.</p>
<p>Scenarios are meant to be run as written, with no addition or subtraction to the number of monsters (unless indicated in the scenario), or changes to armor, feats, items, skills, spells, statistics, traits, or weapons. However, if the actions of the PCs before or during an encounter invalidate the provided tactics or starting locations, the GM should consider whether changing these would provide a more enjoyable play experience.</p>
<p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the right and responsibility to make whatever judgments, within the rules, that you feel are necessary at your table to ensure everyone has a fair and fun experience. This does not mean you can contradict rules or restrictions outlined in this document, a published Pathfinder source, errata document, or official FAQ on <strong>paizo.com</strong>. What it does mean is that only you can judge what is right for your table during cases not covered in these sources.</p>
<p>Additionally, the GM can choose to use terrain and environmental conditions when those effects have been written into the flavor of a scenario but the mechanics associated with such conditions in the <em>Pathfinder</em> <em>Core</em> <em>Rulebook</em> have not been added to the encounters. GMs are always encouraged to reward roleplaying when adjudicating the reactions of NPCs or the outcome of in-game encounters.</p>
<p>GMs may not change the mechanics of encounters. Specifically, for combat encounters, the mechanics include the creatures presented, the number of opponents in the encounter, and the information written into the stat blocks for those opponents. If an encounter is a trap, haunt, or skill check that needs to be achieved to bypass a situation then the listed DCs and results are not to be altered, as they are the mechanics of that encounter. Additionally, if an encounter already includes mechanical effects of terrain, weather, or hazards, please be aware that these things are also considered mechanics that may not be altered. GMs also cannot alter the mechanics of player characters, nor can they ban legal character options from public events.</p>
<p>By contrast, the GM can alter aspects of the scenario’s description and story as appropriate for the players at the table. The section A Welcoming Environment on pages 485–486 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> provides general guidance about how to make your game inviting and inclusive. A few of these sections benefit from additional clarification and examples in the context of Organized Play.</p>
<p>Unlike in long-term campaigns, players and GMs in Organized Play are likely to have limited time in which to set parameters for objectionable content at the beginning of the game. Furthermore, since Organized Play tables often include people who have never met each other before the game, players may not feel comfortable opening up about what they’d rather avoid right from the beginning.  This means that it’s all the more important to start with a common ground for the campaign, to respect what players do share at the beginning of the session, and then be adaptable when it comes to modifying content when problems arise in the course of the session. Pathfinder Society games use the Pathfinder Baseline from page 486 as a starting point when determining what content is appropriate, both for what is present in the published adventures and what is appropriate for player behavior at your table. Add to the Pathfinder Baseline any additional adjustments that are apparent from the situation, such as if you are running a table with children or if you are in a venue with stronger policies about what is appropriate, such as a school.</p>
<p>GMs are empowered to make descriptive adjustments to avoid topics or situations that would cause discomfort for one or more players at the table, such as phobias or other triggering material. For example, a GM could describe a group of spiders as a group of web-shooting lizards or beetles for the comfort of a player with arachnophobia. Mechanically, if a player had an ability that granted benefits against spiders, it would also grant benefits against these other web-shooting creatures during that scenario. Players may not tell you up-front about everything that could cause them trouble; you may learn partway through the session. If this happens, you can “rewind” the description and start over, tweaking the background context of the encounter, or work with the players to create an alternative solution to get around the troublesome aspect of a particular challenge (see <a href="#creative-solutions">Creative Solutions</a> below).</p>
<p>As is the case in general when GMing a table, it is also the GM’s responsibility to ensure that all of the players at the table are respecting each other’s boundaries. If a player refuses to follow along with the adjustment, pushes boundaries, asks insensitive question, or makes fun of a player voicing discomfort with an aspect of the scenario, the GM should intervene. This intervention may just involve giving the player a warning about their inappropriate behavior, but in egregious or continued cases, the GM can remove the offending player from her table (see <a href="#community-standards">Community Standards</a> ).</p>
<p>Whatever changes the GM makes, she should remain true to the fundamental mechanical structure and challenge of the encounter. See the Creative Solutions section below for guidance on how to adjudicate solutions that are not explicitly accounted for in the text of the adventure.</p>
<p>If a particular issue comes up repeatedly or causes a significant problem in one of your games, please raise any questions or concerns on the Pathfinder Society forums at <a href="https://pathfindersociety.club/"><strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong></a>, where Venture-Officers, members of Paizo’s organized play team, or fellow GMs can help you resolve it. Even if there were unlimited time to address such concerns, however, there would always be slight table variation and Game Master discretion. The following sections provide advice on addressing some common table variations you should consider before running a Pathfinder Society game.</p>
<h3 id="creative-solutions">Creative Solutions</h3>
<p>Sometimes during the course of a scenario, your players might surprise you with a creative solution to an encounter (or the entire scenario) that you didn’t see coming and that isn’t expressly covered in the scenario. If, for example, your players manage to roleplay their way through a combat and successfully accomplish the goal of that encounter without killing the antagonist, give the PCs the same reward they would have gained had they defeated their opponent in combat. If that scene specifically calls for the PCs to receive gold piece rewards based on the gear collected from the defeated combatants, instead allow the PCs to find a chest of gold (or something similar) that gives them the same rewards. Additionally, if the PCs miss an NPC who carries a specific potion or scroll that the PCs might be granted access to on the scenario’s Chronicle sheet, don’t cross that item off the sheet—instead, allow the PCs to find the item elsewhere as a reward for creatively resolving the encounter without resorting to combat.</p>
<p>The Pathfinder Society never wants to give the impression that the only way to solve a problem is to kill it. Rewarding the creative use of skills and roleplaying not only make Society games more fun for the players, but it also gives the GM a level of flexibility in ensuring players receive the rewards they are due.</p>
<p>But what if your players accidentally or intentionally kill an important NPC who was supposed to give them a crucial piece of information that’s needed for the scenario to progress? This is a tough problem for the GM and requires improvisation. Don’t decide the scenario is over just because the old man with the letter was caught in a magical crossfire and roasted alive, destroying both him and the important letter. Reveal that the letter survived by some twist of fate (it was in a fire-proof pouch in his pocket) or maybe that the old man had a lackey who was watching from a nearby alley and knows everything the old man did, or another similar explanation. Improvisation will keep your scenario moving forward and help you work around unforeseen obstacles. For more guidance on handling the PCs’ treasure and rewards when they use creative solutions, see the Treasure Bundles section.</p>
<h3>Secret Checks</h3>
<p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, some checks, such as checks to Recall Knowledge, have the secret trait. Secret checks fall into two broad categories. The first category includes checks that characters do not know exist, such as a check against a hidden threat that the PCs did not notice. The second category includes checks for which players would gain significant extra information that their characters would not have if they knew how well they rolled. Recall Knowledge checks are the broadest type of checks that fall into this category. Characters that critically fail a Recall Knowledge check gain false information, so if players know that they rolled very low, they may have trouble avoiding metagaming. Similarly, if the players all rolled low on a check to Seek, they may find themselves tempted to metagame and have everyone roll again because they know that there is likely something that they didn’t find.</p>
<p>The secret trait is a tool to help separate character knowledge and player knowledge, but, as listed in the secret check rules on page 450 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, GMs may at any time allow their players to roll their own results on secret checks. Some scenarios will make recommendations, such as directing GMs to keep a particularly pivotal check’s results hidden or to let players roll a string of checks in the open to keep gameplay moving. Unless a scenario says otherwise, GMs are free to choose how to handle secret checks on a check-by-check basis. GMs can keep all secret checks secret, have players roll all secret checks, or adapt on the fly based on the mood and pacing of the table. If players rolling their own secret checks do metagame—that is, use information that their characters would not have to determine their actions—then inform them that their characters would not have that information and try to steer them away from using it. In general, it can be useful to have players roll their own checks if there are many secret rolls in one section, and useful to roll for the players if you suspect that there will be a strong temptation to metagame or that the extra information of the result could negatively impact the experience for players at the table.</p>
<h2 id="treasure-bundles">Treasure Bundles</h2>
<p>In Pathfinder Society adventures in the Second Edition campaign, PCs recover wealth in the form of Treasure Bundles—a simplified unit that represents an even share of the adventure’s rewards, used for ease of tracking and calculation. Each scenario (designed to grant 4 XP) has a 10 such Treasure Bundles. The Chronicle sheets for quests, Adventure Paths, and Pathfinder Adventures products grant a standardized gold reward.</p>
<p><strong>Variation by Level:</strong> The Second Edition campaign grants each participating PC an amount of wealth based on that PC’s level, no matter the adventure’s tier or the subtier used. For example, a Tier 1–4 scenario would grant 52 gp for a 1st-level PC and 152 to a 3rd-level PC, whether they played Subtier 1–2 or 3–4.</p>
<p><strong>Tracking Treasure Bundles:</strong> Key encounter areas and events in a Pathfinder Society Scenario list how many Treasure Bundles the associated rewards are worth. Each PC earns the same number of Treasure Bundles as the other PCs; some player boons or scenarios might grant an unequal number of Treasure Bundles, but these are infrequent exceptions.</p>
<p>At the end of an adventure, the GM should tally the number of Treasure Bundles the PCs acquired. For non-quest adventures, each PC receives the gold that corresponds to their level on <a href="#table-3-bundle-value">Table 3</a> below, multiplied by the number of Treasure Bundles they recovered. If you prefer, you can instead multiply the number of missed Treasure Bundles by the corresponding gold value and subtract that from the Chronicle sheet’s maximum reward. The math works out the same either way. If you would prefer to consult a table rather than doing the math, see <a href="http://#table-4-total-value">Table 4</a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> Tonya is the GM for the scenario, and her players are John (with a 1st-level character), Mike (2nd-level), Thurston (3rd-level), and Linda (4th-level). The team played exceptionally well and found all 10 Treasure Bundles—the maximum reward! Tonya awards each PC the maximum gold piece reward for their respective levels: John’s PC gets 14 gp as a 1st-level PC, Mike’s gets 22 gp, Thurston’s gets 38 gp, and Linda’s gets 64 gp.</p>
<p>Later that weekend, the same group plays another scenario. This time the group struggles, earning only 7 Treasure Bundles. When calculating the gold earned by John’s PC, Tonya takes the Treasure Bundle value on the table for a 1st-level PC (1.4) and multiplies it by the number of Treasure Bundles (7) to get his PC’s final gold earned: 9.8 gp. Alternatively, Tonya could have multiplied the missing Treasure Bundles (3) by the value (1.4) and subtracted the product from the scenario’s maximum reward for 1st level (14 – [3 x 1.4] = 9.8 gp). The other PCs would earn 15.4 gp (Mike), 26.6 gp (Thurston), and 44.8 gp (Linda).</p>
<p><strong>Expectations and Creative Solutions:</strong> In the course of completing a scenario, the PCs are likely to acquire all 10 Treasure Bundles as part of overcoming challenges and inspecting their surroundings. That said, a non-linear adventure might include encounter areas (and treasure) the PCs miss entirely, and there might be small portions of treasure that a group would overlook entirely (such as hidden in a concealed room). As a result, even a capable party might not secure all 10 Treasure Bundles. Taking into account the free consumable items granted to PCs at the beginning of adventures, the wealth earned by Pathfinder Society characters is slightly higher than the standard provided in the Core Rulebook. That means that although missing the occasional Treasure Bundle stings, it’s accounted for in the campaign.</p>
<p>However, awarding fewer than the maximum Treasure Bundles shouldn’t be a punitive tool. Unless recovering a Treasure Bundle is tied to succeeding at key skill checks or making key choices, PCs who overcome an encounter with creative solutions should earn the same reward they would have earned by defeating that foe in combat. Adventures call out special exceptions, such as treasure only accessible if the PCs investigate a particular secret door or agree to an NPC’s proposal. If the PCs’ actions allow them to bypass the area or encounter where they would have the chance to recover the treasure, it’s okay to relocate the opportunity to a later point with similar requirements to recover the treasure.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> The PCs are supposed to attack a keep, and they successfully trick the guards into escorting the PCs to the final encounter with the evil warlord rather than fighting their way in. By tricking the guards, the PC not only skip the guards fight (which has 2 Treasure Bundles associated with it) and never have a chance to pick up the easily-discovered magic wand in the guardroom (1 additional Treasure Bundle), but they also skip a fight with a minotaur (who guards coins representing 2 Treasure Bundles). The PCs should receive credit for these rewards anyway; they overcame the guards encounter, bypassed the minotaur, and would have easily recovered the treasure afterward.</p>
<p>However, escorting the PCs through the keep also means the PCs neither explore the side rooms nor have a chance to find the secret vault where a golden chalice is hidden (1 Treasure Bundle). Finding this vault would have required a PC Searching during exploration and succeeding at a DC 20 Perception check, and the room’s rewards cite that the PCs should only receive this reward if they find the room and recover the chalice. In this case the PCs should have a fair opportunity to find the chalice anyway, such as the secret door and room being relocated to the warlord’s throne room with the same Perception check DC.</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h2 id="infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</h2>
<p>Players are responsible for their characters’ actions. A player’s perception of what their character would do in a particular situation is never more important than the experience of other players at the table.</p>
<p>Alignment infractions—evil acts committed by PCs in Organized Play—are a touchy subject. Killing an innocent, wanton destruction, and other acts that can be construed as evil might be considered alignment infractions. Ultimately, you are the final authority at the table, but you must warn any player whose character is deviating from his chosen alignment. This warning must be clear, and you must make sure that the player understands the warning and the actions that initiated the warning. The PC should be given the opportunity to correct the behavior, justify it, or face the consequences. You can issue a warning to the player through a “feeling” he receives from his deity, a vision he is given, his conscience talking to him, or some other similar roleplaying event.</p>
<p><strong>Infamy:</strong> When a character expresses the intent to perform a wantonly evil or callously criminal action and you inform them that their action would be considered an evil action, if the character still persists in performing the action, apply a point of Infamy to the character. Up to a certain limit, gaining Infamy does not mandate a change in the character’s alignment, but rather, represents a step towards becoming evil.</p>
<p>Beyond GM intervention, some scenarios and written products may present evil solutions to situations. These actions will be called out within the adventure text as causes to give a character partaking in them a point of Infamy. Still, the GM is the final arbiter on what constitutes an alignment infraction and when Infamy is gained by a character at the table.</p>
<p>Every point of Infamy represents the PC’s reputation for performing evil actions. A character can have a maximum of 3 Infamy before that character must be retired; it is assumed characters with 3 points of Infamy become irrevocably evil and are no longer welcome to join standard Pathfinder Society operations.</p>
<p><strong>Removing Infamy:</strong> A player can reduce their character’s Infamy by spending 12 Fame per point or through the <a href="#untarnished-reputation">Untarnished Reputation</a> faction boon</p>
<p><strong>Effects of Infamy:</strong> A character can have an Infamy score between 0 and 3. The following summarizes the effects of Infamy based on the number of points accrued:</p>
<p>0: No effect. The character is considered in excellent moral standing with the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<p>1: The character has earned a reputation for performing unseemly deeds. The maximum item level of equipment the character can purchase decreases by 1 (to a minimum of level 1 equipment). This typically means that the PC can purchase equipment with an item level equal to their level – 1 and can purchase equipment listed on a Chronicle sheet only if its level is at most 1 higher than their level.</p>
<p>2: The character is infamous for her evil exploits in the name of the Pathfinder Society. The maximum item level of equipment the character can purchase decreases by 2 (to a minimum of level 1 equipment). This typically means the PCs can purchase equipment with an item level equal to her level – 2. A PC with this level of Infamy can purchase equipment listed on her Chronicle sheets only if its level is equal to or less than her level.</p>
<p>3: The character has earned such a reputation that they are barred from participating in Pathfinder Society, unless they reduce their Infamy score to 2 or lower at the end of the adventure. If the character don’t reduce their Infamy score, the character is permanently retired from play.</p>
<p><strong>Major Infractions:</strong> Characters who become wantonly evil by performing vile actions are retired from the campaign when they reach 3 Infamy and cannot reduce the value by spending Fame. This measure is a last resort; players should endeavor to play their characters in ways that are within the constraints of acceptable alignments, even if their characters have gained some Infamy.</p>
<p>If a character is retired as defined above, you should escalate the report to the event coordinator, or the local Venture-Captain or Regional Venture-Coordinator. If that Venture-Officer agrees with you, then the character is deemed wantonly evil and considered removed from the campaign. Again, these measures should be taken as a very last resort.</p>
<p>In the event of a wantonly evil character, record the character as “dead,” and the person who enters the tracking sheet should check that box as well. If the event coordinator, Venture-Captain, or Regional Venture-Coordinator decides the character fits the criteria for being wantonly evil, she will then e-mail the Organized Play manager to advise her of the situation, including the player’s name, organized play number, and e-mail address. A player must be advised of these actions and be provided with a chance to contact their Regional Venture-Coordinator to present their side of the case.</p>
<h2>Dealing with Death</h2>
<p>Given the dangers characters face once they become Pathfinders, character death is a very real possibility (and a necessary one to maintain a sense of risk and danger in the game). Consider, however, that for a player new to Pathfinder Society, or to the Pathfinder RPG in general, having his character experience a violent death during his first game can sour him on the campaign and the game altogether. While we don’t advocate fudging die rolls, consider the experience of the players when deciding whether to use especially lethal tactics or if a character is in extreme danger of death, especially when the player is new to the game. Most players whose first experience in a campaign results in a character death don’t return to the campaign.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the entire party is killed and can’t be brought back to life, then the slot is over for everyone in the party. This means those players may have a substantial span of time before their next event at a convention with no game to play. Obviously, we hope that such total party kills never happen (and strive to balance the scenarios to make it unlikely)—but, sometimes, the dice just aren’t with you and everyone passes into the Great Beyond.</p>
<h2>Cheating</h2>
<p>Cheating is rare, and it can be a rather heated topic. If you suspect that a player is cheating, it’s always a good idea to take a step back and consider the possibility that they are instead making an honest mistake. Inaccurate numbers on a character sheet or mistakes on a Chronicle sheet are far more likely to be math errors than deliberate cheating. When you see these issues, keep an open mind and work with the player to resolve them. Other issues, such as lying about the results of a dice roll or the contents of their character sheet or breaking the rules even after being informed of what they are, are more clear-cut. If you believe the player to be cheating, record the organized play number of the player in question and then ask her to leave your table. Afterward, send an e-mail to the Pathfinder Society staff at <a href="mailto:organizedplay@paizo.com">organizedplay@paizo.com</a>, including the player’s number and detailing as much as you can remember about the situation.</p>
<h2 id="gm-glyph-rewards">GM Glyph Rewards</h2>
<p>The Pathfinder Society offers a GM ranking system. This system uses glyphs to denote the activity and experience of a given GM. The glyphs are visible on your Organized Play ID card. You can earn up to four glyphs for running a certain number of reported games, as follows.</p>
<ul><li>Report 10 adventures as GM = 1 glyph</li>
<li>Report 30 adventures as GM = 2 glyphs</li>
<li>Report 60 adventures as GM = 3 glyphs</li>
<li>Report 100 adventures as GM = 4 glyphs</li>
</ul><p>There are additional requirements beyond number of tables reported to earn 5 glyphs. More information on the fifth glyph will be added to this page in the future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All GMs receive the following rewards based on the number of GM glyphs that they have earned.</p>
<ul><li>When playing a scenario, they can distribute a number of Hero Points equal to their number of glyphs to the other players at the table. Distribute these Hero Points during the portion of the scenario in which players are slotting boons. A player cannot gain more than one Hero Point from the table’s GM glyphs.</li>
<li>They gain the ability to <a href="#replaying-adventures">replay an adventure</a> that grants one Chronicle sheet once per glyph earned.</li>
</ul><p>Paizo recognizes all 5-glyph GMs by name on blogs on <a href="https://paizo.com/"><strong>paizo.com</strong></a>.</p>

			<a name=factions><h1>Factions  </h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
			


<p>Factions have existed within the Pathfinder Society for centuries. However, their history is fraught with controversy, particularly when past factions clashed for control over the Society itself or acted as proxies for various nations’ political aspirations. Following more than a decade of turmoil, growth, and housecleaning, the Society’s current factions are dedicated to promoting different elements of the Pathfinder Society’s charter rather than pushing outside ambitions. Society agents understand that their allegiance is to the Pathfinder Society first.</p>
<p><span id="more-463"></span></p>
<p>You can join more than one faction by purchasing the <a href="#factionboons">relevant boons</a> , but you gain benefits only from the faction you are currently acting for. You must declare which faction you’re acting for at the start of an adventure by slotting its <a href="#boons-boon-slots">boon</a></p>
<p>The following sections describe the various factions, their broad objectives, and their goals during the current year. Following that is a list of those factions’ associated boons, which a PC can purchase with Fame. There are no restrictions on what factions characters can belong to, though some factions lend themselves to particular characters’ skill sets.</p>
<p>The factions are divided into major factions and minor factions. A <strong>major faction</strong> ties very strongly and directly into the Society’s goals—such as emphasizing exploration or research—and has a large number of members within the Pathfinder Society. Major factions regularly drive ongoing storylines, often with a few scenarios per year that have special tie-ins for those factions and grant additional <a href="#fame-and-reputation">Reputation</a>  (a measure of your standing within a faction). A major faction offers four <a href="#reputation-tiers">Reputation Tiers</a>  in Faction Rewards and accompanying rewards. The list of major factions is not expected to undergo significant changes over the course of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Minor Factions</strong> have a smaller profile, a more niche goal, have aims that are more tangential to the Society’s mission, or are tied to a shorter-term objective. Although a minor faction might sometimes be the driving force behind an adventure, these tie-ins occur less frequently than they do for major factions; alternatively, a minor faction might be especially influential for a particular year, after which it steps back from the spotlight. A minor faction offers between two and four <a href="#reputation-tiers">Reputation Tiers</a>  in Faction Rewards (and accompanying rewards; the two current minor factions—Radiant Oath and Verdant Wheel—both offer four Reputation Tiers. The list of minor factions will likely expand over the course of the campaign, occasionally introducing new minor factions to highlight a special season goal or address a particular style of play.</p>
<h2>Major Factions</h2>
<p>The following are the Pathfinder Society’s four major factions.</p>
<h3 id="envoys-alliance">Envoys’ Alliance</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Envoys-Alliance.jpg"><img alt="Envoy's Alliance Faction Symbol" class="alignnone wp-image-486 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Envoys-Alliance-150x150.jpg" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Envoys-Alliance-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Envoys-Alliance-100x100.jpg 100w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>Being a Pathfinder’s dangerous work. Travel comes with its own dangers, traps seem to be everywhere, and just about everything seems ready to eat aspiring agents. What’s more, the Pathfinder Society has spent the last decade increasingly engaged in major conflicts, each of which saw extraordinary rewards yet also loss of life. After virtually nonstop campaigns, the Society’s ranks are sorely depleted. The Envoys’ Alliance aims to change that, making the Society every stronger, better trained, and better supported.</p>
<p><strong id="envoys-alliance-faction-leader">Faction Leader: Fola Barun</strong> (N female half-elf negotiator) first encounter the Pathfinder Society in her role as the envoy of an Ekujae elven community in the Mwangi Expanse, and later joined the Society through a field commission. She quickly established herself as an attentive leader whose even-keeled, professional approach not only expanded the Society’s understanding of the mighty Vanji River, but also helped devastate the Aspis Consortium’s predatory operations along that route. Having never trained at the Grand Lodge or absorbed the conventional Society wisdom imparted to initiates, she was appalled upon first reaching Absalom and learning of the many counts of negligence of the past century. She’s brought a fresh approach to recruitment and supporting agents in the field, which often sees her collaborating (and occasionally clashing) with the deans of the Pathfinder Society’s three schools.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun.png"><img alt="Faction Leader Fola Barun" class="alignnone wp-image-493 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun-150x150.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun-150x150.png 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun-300x300.png 300w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun-768x768.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun-100x100.png 100w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Fola-Barun.png 846w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> Strength in Community</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The Envoys’ Alliance is dedicated to recruiting new agents, rescuing Pathfinders in distress, and rebuilding the Society in a way that supports and values operatives’ lives and wellbeing—at least as much as one can in the adventuring world. Through collaboration, the Society can accomplish ever-greater feats—particularly with a powerful faction to advocate for the Pathfinders themselves when they’re tasked with the Grand Lodge’s latest projects.</p>
<p><strong>Year 1 Goal:</strong> In addition to devastating several nations, the Whispering Tyrant’s rise resulted in hundreds of Pathfinder casualties. The aftermath is a serious wake-up call for the Society, and the Envoys’ Alliance in particular seeks not only to rescue those agents stranded by the recent chaos, but also to provide assistance to other distant operations that have suffered from insufficient support.</p>
<h3>Grand Archive</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Grand-Archive.jpg"><img alt="Grand Archive Faction Symbol" class="alignnone wp-image-487 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Grand-Archive-150x150.jpg" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Grand-Archive-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Grand-Archive-100x100.jpg 100w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>Archaeology is a destructive science, and adventurers tend to be more destructive than most. If the Society is to uphold its mandate to study and preserve the past, then documentation and academic rigor are key. Members of the Grand Archive do not limit themselves to Absalom’s libraries, however; these bold explorers’ voyage to the most exciting sites to chronicle the past in person and share those tales with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Leader:</strong> Although third in line for the Sky Citadel Kraggodan’s throne, <strong>Gorm Greathammer</strong> (LN male dwarf raconteur) has always been drawn to the adventuring lifestyle, and his passion drew him to the Pathfinder Society decades ago. He has since distinguished himself as an explorer and chronicler with numerous publications to his name and countless stories to retell. Even so, he has regularly returned home to help administrate the sky citadel. After withstanding the exhausting Ironfang Invasion and directing peace negotiations with Molthune, he returned to the Grand Lodge on an extended leave of absence from Kraggodan. He now oversees the Grand Archive, promoting scholarship and uncovering centuries-old mysteries to solve at long last. Yet those who would expect the Grand Archive’s leader to be a shy, spectacled sage are in for a surprise; Gorm is daring, boisterous, and ready to get his hands dirty alongside his allies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer.png"><img alt="Faction Leader Gorm Greathammer" class="alignnone wp-image-494 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer-150x150.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer-150x150.png 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer-300x300.png 300w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer-768x768.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer-100x100.png 100w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Gorm-Greathammer.png 892w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> Chronicling the Past</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The Grand Archive promotes the ongoing education of Pathfinder agents, the recovery of ancient knowledge, and the mastery of esoteric lore. Thanks to Gorm Greathammer’s leadership, the faction also encourages travel, so that agents can experience history directly, draw their own conclusions, and ensure that all relics receive the care and curation they deserve—especially where a berserker’s boots might otherwise shatter a priceless statue. After years of neglect and several noteworthy attacks, the Grand Lodge’s written records are a tattered shadow of what they once were, and the Grand Archive is dedicated to restoring the Society’s libraries by seeking replacement texts and long-lost documents the world over.</p>
<p><strong>Year 1 Goal:</strong> Although the Pathfinder Society now keeps track of its myriad, far-flung lodges, the first few centuries involved venture-captains founding, operating, and ultimately abandoning numerous lodges across Avistan and Garund. Not only are these lost lodges an important part of Society history, but many also house libraries with unique, now-forgotten manuscripts. As the Society explores its earliest agents’ exploits, the Grand Archive seeks to track down the lost lodges through historical clues, hoping to recover and preserve the lore sequestered within each one.</p>
<h3>Horizon Hunters</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Horizon-Hunters.jpg"><img alt="Horizon Hunters Faction Symbol" class="alignnone wp-image-488 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Horizon-Hunters-150x150.jpg" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Horizon-Hunters-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Horizon-Hunters-100x100.jpg 100w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>Since the Pathfinder Society’s first day, when adventurers gathered in Absalom to share drinks and swap stories, the Society has been an organization of explorers. The Horizon Hunters is home to those who carry on the proud tradition of ascending the highest peaks, plumbing the darkest depths, and seeing what lies over the next hill. And as sweet as it is to discover a lost ruin or unknown vista, it’s all the better to tell wild tales about the experience and revel in the admiration of peers—particularly if an agent’s deeds might be immortalized in the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>, a widely distributed record of the greatest Pathfinders’ achievements and discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Leader:</strong> Hailing from the Sodden Lands, <strong>Calisro Benarry</strong> (N female half-orc corsair) is a pirate-turned-Pathfinder who made her name as venture-captain of the Arcadian Mariner’s Lodge, a ship-borne Pathfinder lodge aboard the <em>Grinning Pixie</em>, whose command passed between venture-captains every few years. Bucking tradition, Benarry commanded the wheel for a decade, oversaw exploration of the dreaded Gloomspires, and traveled widely before recently being ordered to surrender the ship. She considers that no excuse to settle down, though, and has poured her energy into inspiring curiosity, tenacity, and wanderlust in the Society as a whole, spearheading the Horizon Hunters faction.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry.png"><img alt="Faction Leader Calisro Benarry" class="alignnone wp-image-492 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry-150x150.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry-150x150.png 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry-300x300.png 300w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry-768x768.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry-100x100.png 100w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Calisro-Benarry.png 924w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> Glory Lies Over the Horizon</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The more untouched, unfamiliar, or unknown a site or treasure, the more exhilarating it is to reach it. The Horizon Hunters encourage exploration for its own sake, yet it’s also dedicated to enhancing the reputation of its members—anything from publication in the Pathfinder Chronicles to being the subject of the latest tall tale to circulate the taverns. Iconic objectives include uncovering mythical lost cities, blazing the trail through uncharted territory, and reaching foreboding realms. And if the Pathfinders can look good while doing so, that’s all the better.</p>
<p><strong>Year 1 Goal:</strong> Calisro Benarry longs to rekindle the public’s wonder and admiration of the Society through daring and inspiring adventures, focusing on two goals. First, she encourages Pathfinders to seek out and overcome public challenges, from beating previous records to blazing trails at the behest of influential patrons. Second, because she believes the Society has stuck to the Inner Sea for too long, she is pushing for a major mission to document a distant land—an endeavor that the people of Absalom will be talking about for years to come.</p>
<h3>Vigilant Seal</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Vigilant-Shield.jpg"><img alt="Vigilant Seal Faction Symbol" class="alignnone wp-image-491 size-thumbnail" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Vigilant-Shield-150x150.jpg" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Vigilant-Shield-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Vigilant-Shield-100x100.jpg 100w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>Rune-sealed doors, buried temples, warded vaults, and ancient keeps…these are among the most tantalizing sites for explorers to delve, yet all too often these ruins were abandoned for a good reason: their contents were too dangerous to leave unfettered yet too enduring to destroy outright. The Pathfinder Society has a long track record of unleashing forgotten horrors while in the pursuit of glory and lore. Yet for every imprisoned fiend accidentally released while Pathfinders explore overgrown shrines, the explorers have also uncovered and defeated slumbering evils that would have otherwise emerged to plague the world unforeseen and uncontested. As far as the Vigilant Seal’s concerned, this tradition of cavalier recklessness must change.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Leader:</strong> Among the most famous Pathfinders of the previous decade, <strong>Eando Kline</strong> (CG male human explorer) famously explored Varisia, infiltrated the Hold of Belkzen, and plumbed the Darklands’ depths to uncover a lost serpentfolk city. Knowing that further publicity would encourage exploration and goad the serpentine villains to attack the surface, Kline returned to the Grand Lodge ahead of his rival Arnois Belzig, urging the Decemvirate not to publish either of their findings about the site. The Decemvirate dismissed his concerns, and in disgust, Eando Kline resigned from the Society. For the past decade he’s led his own expeditions, always endeavoring to explore more responsibly than the organization he left behind. Yet with news of a change in the Decemvirate and respected colleagues rising to positions of power, Eando Kline has returned to the Society at last, accepting his old <em>wayfinder</em> so long as he can lead in the organization’s reform.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline.png"><img alt="Faction Leader Eando Kline" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-497" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline-150x150.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline-150x150.png 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline-300x300.png 300w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline-768x768.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline-100x100.png 100w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Eando-Kline.png 856w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> Protect, Contain, Destroy</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Just as the Pathfinder Society decrees that its agents must “Explore, report, and cooperate,” the Vigilant Seal expects its agents to “Protect, contain, and destroy.” Dangerous artifacts are often best kept deep within the Grand Lodge or other secure sites, rather than left where they might cause harm. Where slumbering evils lie chained, agents are expected to ensure every link remains strong. And where those goals are impossible, those agents must be ready to neutralize the threat. The Vigilant Seal encourages its agents to be educated enough to identify and understand hazards, and Eando Kline believes that individual Pathfinders must exercise their own discretion in assessing the danger and knowing when to intervene.</p>
<p><strong>Year 1 Goal:</strong> The Pathfinder Society’s past is replete with buried dangers, both in sites of expeditions that were never completed and in the vaults below the Grand Lodge. Now that the Society’s leadership has become enamored with unearthing the exploits of the earliest Pathfinders, it’s only a matter of time before agents inadvertently unleash a devastating curse or threat that the likes of Pathfinder Society cofounders Durvin Gest or Selmius Foster thought it wiser not to disturb—Vigilant Seal members must be ready to avert such dangers whenever possible, and to quickly neutralize them if not.</p>
<h2>Minor Factions</h2>
<p>The following are the minor factions in the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<h3>Radiant Oath</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Radiant-Oath.jpg"><img alt="Radiant Oath Faction Symbol" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-489" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Radiant-Oath-150x150.jpg" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Radiant-Oath-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Radiant-Oath-100x100.jpg 100w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>The Society’s mission doesn’t intrinsically involve acts of altruism, heroism, and sacrifice, yet in many areas Pathfinders are known for thwarting evil, lending a helping hand, and representing their organization as upstanding folk. For the Radiant Oath, this benevolence extends beyond incidental assistance. Instead, the faction sees the Society’s broad reach as an excellent vector for assisting others the world over. Those who join the Radiant Oath swear simple vows to assist others, expanding on these promises the more they serve the faction.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Leader:</strong> No stranger to peril, <strong>Valais Durant</strong> (LG female aasimar ritualist) set out for Numeria after earning her <em>wayfinder</em> and distinguished herself in covert operations there and in Ustalav. When the Society needed agents to investigate the possible misdeeds of Venture-Captain Thurl, she volunteered, directing her practiced senses to uncover his crimes. Unfortunately, she fell prey to his guardians and magic, ultimately being transformed into an amalgam of demonflesh. She fought off her new form’s abyssal influence long enough to return to the Society, and there she sought to restore her mortal form. Her journey took her as far away as Heaven, where with other Pathfinders, she uncovered a ritual to remove the demonic corruption safely. The ritual exceeded her greatest expectations. Rather than restoring her human body, Heaven granted her a celestial form.</p>
<p>Even though she’s still adjusting to her new body and celestial connection, Valais is committed to helping others as the Society helped her. Rather than crushing her spirit, her exposure to dark rituals and demonic whispers has taught her what’s at stake if evil prevails, granting her the strength to defeat fiends and assist the vulnerable in equal measure. Her supernatural powers don’t blind her to her own biases, though. Valais knows that her own perspective of justice and benevolence is but one of many the world over, so she recruits faction members of diverse backgrounds to spread good in their own ways while respecting the sensibilities and values of unfamiliar cultures.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant.png"><img alt="Faction Leader Valais Durant" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-496" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant-150x150.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant-150x150.png 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant-300x300.png 300w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant-768x768.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant-100x100.png 100w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Valais-Durant.png 927w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> A Light in the Shadows</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Unlike its spiritual predecessor, the Silver Crusade, which threw itself forcefully at the most significant threats and villains, the Radiant Oath emphasizes acts of kindness, compassion, and redemption. However, when dire evils threaten the world, the members of the Radiant Oath are ready to combat it. By consistently promoting the cause of good and building the faction’s reputation, the Radiant Oath strives for greater influence in the Society to direct its resources toward just causes.</p>
<h3>Verdant Wheel</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Verdant-Wheel.jpg"><img alt="Verdant Wheel Faction Symbol" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-490" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Verdant-Wheel-150x150.jpg" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Verdant-Wheel-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction_Verdant-Wheel-100x100.jpg 100w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p>No matter how many verdant jungles, grassy plains, and untamed hills agents scout, the Pathfinder Society is not strictly a nature-oriented organization. Even so, nature enthusiasts of all stripes—from grizzled trackers to bright-eyed ecologists to tenacious druids—gravitate to the Society for opportunities to witness natural wonders, catalog new species, and better protect the world’s pristine realms. The call for a united voice representing those interests has only grown over the years, and the evolution of the Pathfinder Society provides a perfect opportunity to name this organization: the Verdant Wheel. This faction has a particular fondness for sensing patterns and cycles, such as that of creation and destruction, as exemplified by new growth sprouting from a fire-ravaged field, but those intent on preserving that which exists also find a welcome home here.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Leader:</strong> Nobody entirely agrees on where <strong>Urwal</strong> (NG male lizardfolk astrologer) came from, though one Pathfinder admits to having encountered him in Varisia several years ago and being accosted about a copy of the Pathfinder Chronicles containing misleading information. Flustered, the Pathfinder told Urwal that if he were so upset, he could visit the Grand Lodge and file a complaint. In 4718 ar, Master of Scrolls Kreighton Shaine entered his locked office to find Urwal waiting there with five heavily edited volumes of the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>, a stack of supporting documentation, and a disappointed glower. “These are full of errors. I question that your agents even traveled to these places. I will bring more; the stars foresee it,” declared the lizardfolk before clambering up a wall and out the window.</p>
<p>After finding Urwal reorganizing neglected entomology collections, correcting placards on a collection of Mwangi artifacts, and painting astrological charts on a Grand Lodge walkway—all helpful yet cryptically explained—the deans of the three Pathfinder Society schools decided it more prudent to recognize Urwal’s esoteric knowledge and benign infiltration by granting him a field commission (which the lizardfolk has never formally accepted). That he has since organized a cohort of nature enthusiasts as the Verdant Wheel befuddles the Society’s leadership, especially since nobody has yet figured out where he came from (including the Verdant Wheel’s agents, who maintain ongoing bets about his origins). For all his eccentricities, he is a compassionate mentor who encourages his colleagues to seek out natures greatest wonders and most humble treasures, understand them, and protect them in the way each agent deems best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal.png"><img alt="Faction Leader Urwal" class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-495" height="150" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" src="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal-150x150.png" srcset="http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal-150x150.png 150w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal-300x300.png 300w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal-768x768.png 768w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal-100x100.png 100w, http://www.organizedplayfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Faction-Leader-Urwal.png 953w" width="150"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Motto:</strong> Truth Sprouts from the Ashes</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> The Verdant Wheel has no single vision of what it means to preserve nature, leaving it to an individual’s interpretation and each region’s unique circumstances to determine the best course of action. Agents travel far and wide to study the strange and pristine, and their journeys often bring them into conflict with undead, fiends, and aberrations. Most of all, the faction is a home for those who revel in the glories of nature in its many forms—even the occasional alien landscape beyond Golarion itself.</p>

<p>Factions offer a variety of rewards. These a PC can access by gaining Reputation with a particular faction and then spending Fame to purchase specific boons. In addition to faction-specific rewards, there are numerous generic rewards that are accessible to all factions based on the amount of Reputation a PC's earned. The rewards take the form of boons, which follow the same rules as those found in the <a href="#player-rewards-boons">Boons</a> section.  You can slot only one boon with the promotional trait at the same time.</p>
<p><span id="more-476"></span></p>
<p>The first Faction Champion boon you select is free. You can select free rewards at any time, even before you play your first adventure.</p>
<p><strong id="reputation-tiers">Reputation Tiers:</strong> By representing a faction during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction's interests, a PC gains Reputation with that faction. The greater a PC's Reputation with a faction, the more respected and influential they are with that faction, represented by their Reputation Tier. These tiers are numbered 0 through 4, with a Reputation Tier of 0 representing no relationship with the faction, and a Reputation Tier of 4 representing the height of prestige within the faction. To advance to a higher Reputation Tier, a PC must increase their Reputation for that faction to the values listed in the following table.</p>
<p>Major factions include rewards for all five Reputation Tiers, whereas minor factions typical have rewards only for Reputation Tiers 0–3.</p>

<p class="boondetails">When you acquire this boon choose an alchemical item or potion of your level or lower to which you have access. While you have this boon slotted, you can spend Downtime to search for rare herbs and ingredients in order to craft up to a full batch of this item (typically 4). This uses the same rules as you would to Craft the item, with the following exceptions. First, you must use Nature, Survival, or Herbalism Lore in place of Crafting (such as to determine the progress you make and the maximum item level you can work on). Second, your faction provides you the necessary tools and workspace to perform this operation. Third, you only need to spend 2 days of Downtime before attempting your first skill check and subsequently beginning to reduce the item's effective cost. You must keep this boon slotted until you finish crafting the items.</p>

<p class="boondetails">You have met, interviewed, and mentored numerous promising recruits, yet it is thanks to your persuasive overtures and keen eye that you identified and recruited an especially accomplished agent. When you select this boon, it does not apply to your current character. Instead, select one of your Pathfinder Society characters with 0 XP. That character gains 12 XP, 12 Fame, 30 gp, and 12 Reputation to distribute among any number of legal factions.</p>
<p class="boondetails"><strong>Special</strong> You can apply this benefit to the same character to whom you applied the Eager Protégé benefit, so long as that PC still has 12 XP. If you do so, you instead increase that character's XP by 12 (to 24 total), award them an additional 12 Reputation to distribute between one or more factions, and grant them an additional 45 gp (for a total of 75 gp).</p>

<p><span id="more-466"></span></p>
<h3>Early Explorer                     Background</h3>
<p>In the past decade, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with demonic armies, meddled in politics, and more, but you joined the organization before everything seemed so complicated. Whether you’re a dedicated scholar of ruins or an explorer who just longs for months-long expeditions into the wilderness, you’re a Pathfinder to explore, report, and cooperate.</p>

<h3>Shadow War Survivor       Background</h3>
<p>Countless factions have fought for influence in Absalom for millennia, and for decades these groups worked through the Pathfinder Society to better control the City at the Center of the World. Perhaps you were ones of these agents who clashed with other operatives during the so-called Shadow War. Or you might have been an unintended victim of these clandestine clashes, inspiring you to join the Society and stop the conflict from within. Whatever the reason, navigating the Shadow War has left you politically savvy and informed.</p>

<h3>Shadow Lodge Defector  Background</h3>
<p>You were among the Pathfinders recruited by the devious Shadow Lodge, lured in by promises of wealth, reform, justice, or revenge. You might have fought against the Society’s loyal agents, helped sabotage the Pathfinders’ reputation in distant countries, or even infiltrated the far-flung lodges as a spy. You’ve since made peace with and rejoined the Pathfinder Society, yet the underhanded reflexes and skills you learned are hard to forget.</p>

<p>You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the Lie to Me skill feat.</p>

<h3>Ruby Phoenix Enthusiast Background</h3>
<p>Named for the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix Tournament occurs once every 10 years in Goka and attracts extraordinary talent from across the world. You might have begun training for the tournament but never participated, or perhaps you entered the tournament only to be defeated by (and inspired to join) the Pathfinder Society. Either way, your dedicated training prepares you for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the Combat Climber skill feat. In addition, you gain access to one of the following uncommon monk weapons: kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, or temple sword.</p>

<h3>Thassilonian Delver          Background</h3>
<p>As archaeologists uncovered and explored ever-larger numbers of Thassilonian ruins, you were among the eager explorers who sought out the Runelords’ ancient secrets.

Or perhaps you explored several of these sites yourself, quickly learning to parse the arcane secrets before lest the eldritch magic extinguish your life.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilonian History Lore skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. Add Thassilonian to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer                      Background</h3>
<p>For over a century, Mendev led a multinational coalition against ever-growing abyssal invaders in the Worldwound, and the Pathfinder Society aided in the so-called Fifth Crusade that ultimately sealed the planar rift and defeated its demon armies. You might be a hardened recruit who clashed with the demons, or perhaps you were a survivor who lost everything to the fiendish armies and narrowly escaped—or was rescued by Pathfinders. Your exposure to the Worldwound has taught you vital lessons in identifying fiends and their magic.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Religion skill and the Demon Lore skill. You gain the Recognize Spell skill feat. Add Abyssal to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>

<h3>Scholar of the Sky Key     Background</h3>
<p>The unfamiliar technology of Numeria’s Silver Mount still baffles Society scholars, yet you are one of the innovators who discovered how to operate a handful of these futuristic tools—possibly after surviving more than a few explosions. The Society might have recruited you for your esoteric abilities, or you might have sought out the Society’s protection in escaping the covetously vile Technic League. Even if your understanding of advanced technology is imperfect, your hard-learned lessons are invaluable in deciphering and repairing gear.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.</p>

<p>For more than a century, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with the avaricious and underhanded Aspis Consortium, and several years ago the Society dealt its rival a decisive blow. You may be one of the few survivors of a doomed Aspis expedition, or perhaps you chafed at the Consortium’s villainous practices and defected to the Pathfinders. No matter your reasons, you know how to be efficient and ruthless when the circumstances demand.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Aspis Consortium Lore skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. You gain access to any uncommon options as though you were a member of the Aspis Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 7 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>

<p>Upon securing the <em>Untouchable Opal</em>, an artifact of extraordinary power, the Pathfinder Society endeavored to free the benevolent demigod Ranginori, who was trapped within the virtually unbreakable prison. You might have joined the Pathfinder Society in its expeditions to the Elemental Planes, or you might have lived on one of those planes before learning of the Society from these Pathfinder agents. You are no stranger to navigating precarious terrain as a result.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill, plus either Elemental Lords Lore or a Lore skill related either to one of the Elemental Planes (such as Plane of Air Lore). You gain the Cat Fall skill feat. Add Auran to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 8 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Faction Opportunist          Background</h3>
<p>As the Pathfinder Society’s influence has grown, so too did many of its factions become wealthier and more powerful. These factions relied on a host of Pathfinders and independent operatives alike to establish trade networks, shape national politics, and more, and you were among the specialists who helped one of these factions realize its goal. These events provided you countless opportunities to develop your own contacts and negotiating skills.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill, plus either Guild Lore, Heraldry Lore, or Mercantile Lore. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.</p>

<h3>Tapestry Refugee               Background</h3>
<p>Within her magnificent museum demiplane, the sorcerer Hao Jin extracted and preserved countless sites and cultures. The demiplane’s unraveling magic forced the Pathfinder Society to evacuate the many inhabitants recently, and you were among the refugees who returned to the Material Plane after centuries of isolation. Whether you joined the Society out of gratitude, curiosity, or desperation, you are hardened by your harrowing flight from your doomed home.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Medicine or Stealth skill, plus a Lore skill related to the terrain you lived in while on the demiplane (such as Cave Lore or Desert Lore). You gain the Assurance skill feat with the skill you chose to become trained in (Medicine or Stealth).</p>

			<a name=chopt><h1>Character Options  </h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
			


<p>Character options from the following books are available in Pathfinder Society. Your character has access to all common items from these books except as otherwise listed. Your character can gain access to Uncommon options or even rare options from a variety of sources, such as class abilities, Chronicle sheets, and boons. Some particularly thematic uncommon options are available to all characters; these are listed below.</p>
<p><span id="more-475"></span></p>
<p>To select an option from a book other than the Pathfinder Core Rulebook, you must own the source and bring it to the table. Your character must qualify for the option’s prerequisites, such as being high-enough level to select the option. Characters can purchase items of up to their level, or up to their level + 2 when they appear on a Chronicle sheet. For more on item purchases, see <a href="#purchasing-guidelines">Purchasing Guidelines</a></p>
<h2 class="H2">Pathfinder Core Rulebook</h2>
<p><strong>Common</strong>:<br/><em>Connections</em> skill feat – not legal<br/><em>Experienced Smuggler</em> skill feat – Allows you to always Earn Income with the Underworld Lore with tasks of your level -1 (instead of the normal level -2).</p>
<p><strong>Uncommon</strong>:<br/><em>Wayfinder</em> – all Pathfinders have access.</p>
<h2 class="H2">Pathfinder Bestiary</h2>
<p class="Body"><strong>Common:</strong><i><br/></i>When a rules option from another book references the statistics for a common creature in the Bestiary, such as the riding horse that PCs can purchase in the <i>Core</i> <i>Rulebook</i> or the spell summon animal, all relevant common creatures from the <i>Bestiary</i> are available for play.</p>
<p class="Bodyindent"><strong>Uncommon:</strong><br/>
No uncommon options in this book are available to Pathfinder Society characters.</p>

<p>In addition to the terms and abbreviations used in Pathfinder, Pathfinder Society uses the following.</p>
<p><span id="more-480"></span></p>
<p><strong>Access:</strong> This stat block entry indicates that you can use a rules element even though it’s uncommon by virtue of belonging to a particular organization, hailing from a particular region, or meeting another such criterion. For example, members of the Pathfinder Society begin with access to most options of common rarity, but also gain access to <em>wayfinders</em> because of their membership in that organization, even though <em>wayfinders</em> are uncommon in Golarion. See <a href="#special-rewards">Special Rewards</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Achievement Points (ACP):</strong> Achievement Points are a reward for participating in the Pathfinder Society Campaign, earned through playing and GMing adventures. You can redeem these points for special boons for your characters. See <a href="#special-rewards">Special Rewards</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Adventure:</strong> The term “adventure” collectively refers to Pathfinder Society Quests, Pathfinder Society Scenarios, products in the Pathfinder Adventures line, and Adventure Path volumes.  See <a href="#types-of-adventures">Types of Adventures</a></p>
<p><strong>Alignment Infraction:</strong> An alignment infraction is any intentionally evil action or suitably callous criminal action that results in a character gaining Infamy. The consequences of alignment infractions vary from limits on purchases to forced retirement of a character from the Pathfinder Society campaign. See <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Boon:</strong> A boon is an in-game reward other than Experience Points, wealth, Fame, Downtime, or item access. Boons appear on Chronicle sheets, typically earned as part of an adventure or as a reward in exchange for Achievement Points. See <a href="#player-rewards-boons">Boons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Challenge Points:</strong> Challenge Points represent the overall strength of all of the PCs at the table. This number determines what modifications to an adventure, if any, the GM should use to ensure the degree of difficulty is appropriate. See <a href="#challenge-points">Challenge Points</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Character Options:</strong> The Character Options page lists what items, classes, spells, feats, and other character options from books published by Paizo Inc. are legal for Pathfinder Society Organized Play characters, and what rules elements they gain access to as a result of their membership in Pathfinder Society. See <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chronicle Sheet:</strong> This is usually a record of an adventure that a character has completed, recording any Experience Points, wealth, Fame, Reputation, boons, or item access the character earned. Some Chronicle sheets grant special rewards that are not associated with an adventure and are instead earned by spending Achievement Points or from other opportunities. You must bring all Chronicle sheets for a character to Organized Play games in order to be able to use that character, but if you have them, you can play that character at any Pathfinder Society event of the appropriate level anywhere in the world! See <a href="#after-the-adventure">After the Adventure</a> for more on rewards granted by Chronicle sheets and <a href="#chronicle-sheets-and-record-keeping">Chronicle Sheets and Record-Keeping</a> XXOP Basics&lt; Chronicle Sheets and Record-Keeping for how to read and fill out a Chronicle sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Companion Creature:</strong> Any permanent companion (e.g., an animal companion, familiar, or mount) that accompanies the PC, can take actions in combat, and is acquired through a PC’s class features is referred to as a companion creature.</p>
<p><strong>Community Standards:</strong> These are the basic expectations of conduct to which everyone must adhere when participating in the Pathfinder Society campaign. See <a href="#community-standards">Community Standards</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Credit:</strong> A player or GM who receives credit for an adventure earns a Chronicle sheet for it. In general, you can earn credit for an adventure twice—once as a GM and once as a player—though there are exceptions to this rule, such as <a href="#tag-repeatable">repeatable scenarios</a></p>
<p><strong>Downtime:</strong> This is a unit of time granted by a Chronicle sheet that a character can spend to perform a number of activities, such as Crafting or attempting to Earn Income. See <a href="#downtime">Op Basics</a>  for the time granted by different types of adventures and <a href="#downtime">Player Basics</a>  for how to use Downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Act:</strong> An evil act is an act that, on its own or as part of a pattern, would push your alignment toward evil. An individual evil act may or may not grant Infamy. See <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Faction:</strong> Pathfinder Society agents all have their own loyalties and motivations, even within the Society. A faction represents your PC’s secondary loyalties cw. See <a href="#factions">Factions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fame:</strong> Fame represents your character’s social currency within the Pathfinder Society and is gained from successfully completing adventures. You can spend Fame to purchase boons and services from the Society or its various factions. See <a href="#fame-and-reputation">Fame</a>  and <a href="#factionboons">Faction Boons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Game Master (GM):</strong> A GM adjudicates the rules and controls the elements of the story and world that the players explore, providing a fair and fun game. In Pathfinder Society, a GM must also help players accurately fill out their paperwork and report the results of each game to the event coordinator or on <a href="https://pathfindersociety.club/"><strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Golarion:</strong> The planet of Golarion is the setting for the majority of Pathfinder Society adventures. See <a href="#wopf">The World of Pathfinder Society</a> for more information about this magical and dangerous land.</p>
<p><strong>GM Glyphs:</strong> GM glyphs are a measure of how many Pathfinder Society games a person has run. Earning the fifth glyph requires <a href="#gm-glyph-rewards">several additional steps</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Infamy:</strong> A PC gains Infamy when they knowingly commit evil acts. The consequences of accruing Infamy range from limits on purchases to forced retirement of a character from the Pathfinder Society campaign. See <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions.</a></p>
<p><strong>Interactive:</strong> Interactive adventures are special adventures in which multiple groups of players participate in the same adventure, and their combined results impact each other’s experience and the adventure’s results. New interactive adventures are typically introduced at PaizoCon or Gen Con and are available at other conventions that meet a given adventure’s minimum number of participating tables.</p>
<p><strong>Legal Source:</strong> A legal source is a physical copy of a book, a name-watermarked pdf of a book, or a printout of one or more pages from a name-watermarked pdf. In order to use a character option, you must own and have on hand a legal source that contains that option. See <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Nonplayer Character (NPC): </strong>This is a character run by the GM who the player characters can interact with.</p>
<p><strong>Organized Play Manager (OPM):</strong> The Organized Play manager administers any organized play campaigns, including Pathfinder Society, the First Edition Pathfinder Society, Pathfinder Adventure Card Society, and Starfinder Society.</p>
<p><strong>Organized Play ID:</strong> Each participant in the Pathfinder Society has an Organized Play ID, assigned either by <strong>paizo.com</strong> when you register for the Organized Play program or by the GM for your first adventure, if you haven’t registered yet. Each character you register also has a hyphenated ID number; the first portion is your ID number, and the second begins with “200” followed digits specific to that character (e.g., # 123456–2002 refers to player number 123456 and the second PC they registered). This number is used when reporting completed adventures and should appear on each Chronicle sheet and inventory tracking sheet associated with your characters. See the <a href="#register">Quick Start Guide</a>  for how to obtain an Organized Play ID.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder Reference Document (PRD):</strong> This is a free online version of the Pathfinder rules, available at <a href="http://paizo.com/prd"><strong>paizo.com/prd</strong></a>. The PRD is not a legal source, but is available as a quick reference. GMs in particular may find it useful to reference the PRD when preparing and running adventures.</p>
<p><strong>Pathfinder School:</strong> The Pathfinder Society’s training program is broken up into three schools: the Spells, the Scrolls, and the Swords, each of which represents a different facet of an initiate’s education. See <a href="#fame-and-reputation">Pathfinder Training</a>  for the benefits these schools grant and <a href="#wopf">The World of Pathfinder Society</a> for more information about their role in Golarion.</p>
<p><strong>Player Character (PC):</strong> This is a character portrayed by a player, rather than by a GM.</p>
<p><strong>Pregenerated Character (Pregen):</strong> These are pre-made characters designed for quick use by players who may not have a character of their own or want to try a new character class. Some scenarios also provide special pregenerated characters.</p>
<p><strong>Quest:</strong> Pathfinder Quests are short adventures designed to last about 1 hour and are written specifically for the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<p><strong>Regional Venture Coordinator (RVC; real world):</strong> Regional Venture-Coordinators, under the guidance of the Organized Play Manager, supervise a large section of the world and support Venture-Captains, Venture-Lieutenants and Venture-Agents in their duties.</p>
<p><strong>Repeatable:</strong> Repeatable adventures are those that a player may replay (or be the GM for) any number of times and still earn a Chronicle sheet with full rewards each time. These adventures are marked with a Repeatable tag on their title pages and on their product pages on <strong>paizo.com</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Replay:</strong> A player replays a scenario when they play it more than once. See <a href="#replaying-adventures">Replaying Adventures</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reporting Sheets:</strong> These are pages that record the characters used at a table, their factions, and their Organized Play IDs. In Pathfinder Scenarios and Quests, these are found at the back of the adventure; for other sanctioned adventures, they’re a separate download on the adventure’s product page on <strong>paizo.com</strong>. See <a href="#your-duties-as-game-master">Your Duties as Game Master</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reputation:</strong> Reputation represents your character’s current standing with a faction. A character can have multiple Reputation scores, each with a different faction. The higher a Reputation score with a faction, the more resources are available for purchase from that faction. See <a href="#factionboons">Faction Boons</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Retraining:</strong> This is the process for changing features of your character after 1st level, either by using Downtime or by using a special boon. See <a href="#downtime-retraining">Retraining</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Revere:</strong> In Organized Play, a character who reveres one or more deities, pantheons, or philosophies pays homage without receiving rules benefits such as spells or access to abilities that require worship. Player characters can revere any Golarion-specific deity, pantheon, or philosophy without alignment restriction. This extends to evil deities as well, so long as the PC does not participate in or glorify activities that violate the Pathfinder Baseline or otherwise incur an alignment infraction (see <em>Pathfinder Core</em> <em>Rulebook</em> 486 and <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Sanctioned Adventure:</strong> Sanctioned adventures were not originally written for Pathfinder Society, but they have been approved for use within the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Pathfinder Scenarios are adventures that typically take 4–5 hours to complete, written specifically for the Pathfinder Society. Most adventures in the campaign are scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Season:</strong> A season is a yearlong period that begins at Gen Con (typically August). Most seasons have a unifying theme and contain about 25 scenarios, with two usually released per month.</p>
<p><strong>Subtier:</strong> This is a small level range within a tier used to scale the difficulty of an adventure for groups of PCs with different levels. See <a href="#challenge-points">Challenge Points</a> for how to determine which subtier and other adjustments to use.</p>
<p><strong>Tier:</strong> This is a range of character levels that can participate in an adventure. Scenario tiers are usually subdivided into subtiers. A PC cannot participate in an adventure if the PC’s level at the start of the adventure is outside that adventure’s tier.</p>
<p><strong>Venture-Agent (VA; real-world):</strong> A Venture-Agent (VA) is a dedicated volunteer coordinator who directs operations at one venue.</p>
<p><strong>Venture-Captain (in-game</strong>): Rather than travel widely, some Pathfinders establish lodges where they can coordinate local agents, store regional lore, and provide a safe refuge for their colleagues. In scenarios, venture-captains are often the NPCs who brief the PCs on their next mission or opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>Venture-Captain (VC; real-world):</strong> Named after the in-game leaders of the Pathfinder Society, Venture-Captains are the many dedicated <a class="encyclopedia" href="#vol" title="Over 90,000 players and 17,000 active GMs participate in Paizo organized play activities.

<p><strong>Worship:</strong> In Organized Play, worship refers to a relationship between a character and a deity where the character gains a mechanical benefit (e.g., a cleric’s spells and abilities or access to options tied to that deity) in exchange for their dedicated worship. A PC may worship only one deity and must choose a deity that accepts worshippers of their alignment. However, the PC cannot participate in or glorify activities that violate the Pathfinder baseline or otherwise incur an alignment infraction (see <em>Pathfinder Core</em> <em>Rulebook</em> 486 and <a href="#infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and Alignment Infractions</a>).</p>

		<a name="vol"><h1>Volunteer Coordinators</h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
		


<p>To coordinate this pool of global volunteers, Paizo has teamed up with the Organized Play Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization created to help bring together gamers and to promote education through strategic games. Volunteers with the Organized Play Foundation choose which organized play program, in our case Paizo, and the scope of their activities, anything from a local game store to an entire country or continent, to provide regular gaming opportunities for gamers in each region.</p>
<p>Volunteers, collectively known as Venture-Officers, receive ranks based on their duties and geographical areas of responsibility. The top level of volunteers, Regional Venture-Coordinators, looks after geographical areas. Under them are Venture-Captains, responsible for countries, states, or metropolitan areas. Their right hands, the Venture-Lieutenants, assist in the area's coordination efforts, sometimes belonging to the region and other times being assigned to a city or town. The lowest level, Venture-Agents, coordinate activities in one location, such as a game store, a school, a community center, or a military instillation.</p>
<p>The current roster of Paizo Venture-Officers is online at <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators"><strong>paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators</strong></a>. Players looking for organized play activities in their area should contact their closest Venture-Officer. If you are unsure who your local Venture-Officer is, find your state or country in the list below and contact the associated Regional Venture-Coordinator.</p>
<p>Anyone may join the Organized Play Foundation as a volunteer. A list of recommended tasks and benefits for each level of Venture-Officer rank is located at <strong><a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators/volunteer">paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators/volunteer</a></strong>If you read the Venture-Officer descriptions and are interested in joining the team, complete the volunteer interest form linked at the bottom of the Organized Play Foundation webpage listed above. The Regional Venture-Coordinator for your area will receive your information and establish contact to bring you onboard the team.</p>
