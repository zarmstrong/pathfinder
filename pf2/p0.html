<p>This short guide is for players who are new to Pathfinder Society. It explains the basics of how to join the Pathfinder Society and play in Pathfinder Society Organized Play games.</p>
<p><span id="more-456"></span></p>
<h2 id="register">Register for Organized Play</h2>
<p>To ensure you have access to all the tools and benefits available to our players, you need to register a <strong>paizo.com</strong> account for organized play.   If you have not yet created an account, you can do so by navigating to <a href="https://paizo.com/">paizo.com</a>, clicking “Sign In” in the upper righthand corner of the page, and then clicking the “Create New Account” button and following the instructions on the following pages.</p>
<p>Once you’ve created a <strong>paizo.com</strong> account, log in and hover over the “My Account” tab in the upper-right corner of the screen and select “Organized Play” from the dropdown menu (for mobile phone users, you may need to tap on “My Account” for the dropdown to appear). This will take you to your personalized Paizo Organized Play page. From here, you can download a copy of your Organized Play ID Card, examine or update any of the characters you register, and view a log of the sessions you’ve played.</p>
<p><strong id="register-new-character">To register a new character</strong>, click “Register a New Pathfinder Society (2nd edition) Character” near the bottom of the page.</p>
<p><strong>If you don’t have a chance to register before your first game</strong>, your Game Master (GM) will give you an Organized Play ID number you can input when you do register to get credit for that game.</p>
<h2>Learn the Community Standards</h2>
<p>All participants in Organized Play must adhere to the <a href="#community-standards">community standards</a>—read through them and uphold them at all Organized Play events and sessions.</p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>Next, you need a character to play. You can either use a pre-generated character or create your own character.</p>
<h3>Using a Pregenerated Character</h3>
<p>If you don’t have time to create a new character or want to try out a new character class, you can use a pregenerated character, also called a pregen. The Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild offers free pregenerated characters based on Pathfinder’s iconic characters, available at<strong> <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">paizo.com</a></strong> or from your local event coordinator. You can find more information on pregenerated characters <a href="#pregenerated-characters">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
<p>Character creation for the Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild follows the guidelines in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, with a few additional Roleplaying Guild-specific rules and benefits. <a href="#character-creation">Character Creation</a>  contains step-by-step instructions to help you create your own Roleplaying Guild character and explains organization’s special rules and benefits. Read instructions rules carefully to ensure your character is suitable for the organized play campaign. All Pathfinder Society characters must start at 1st level.</p>
<p><strong>Character Options:</strong> All of the ancestries, backgrounds, and classes from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are available to you when creating a character. You may need to spend <a href="#player-rewards-boons">Achievement Points</a>  to access some ancestries and options from other books before you can use them in organized play. More information on approved resources can be found in the upcoming Character Options document.</p>
<h2>Before the Adventure Session</h2>
<p>At the game table, introduce yourself to the other players and the Game Master. Take this time to determine which character within the adventure’s tier (range of levels) you want to play—this can be a character you created or a pregenerated character. The GM will also pass around a sign-in sheet to record your character’s name, level, <a href="#factions">faction</a>, and Organized Play ID (if you don’t have an Organized Play ID yet, your GM can assign you one).  During this time, you also need to decide whether you are using <a href="#after-the-adventure-advancement-speed">Standard Advancement or Slow Advancement.</a>  (Slow advancement lets you play more scenarios with that same character before you reach the maximum level; standard advancement helps you level up and become powerful more quickly).</p>
<h2>During the Adventure</h2>
<p>In addition to the game rules in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, Pathfinder Society Organized Play has several additional rules for gameplay. These are the two most important.</p>
<h3>One Character per Adventure</h3>
<p>You can have as many active characters as you want in Pathfinder Society. However, you can play only one of your characters during a specific adventure. If a fourth character is needed to meet the minimum number of characters per table, the fourth character must be a pregenerated character. The GM can assign a player to play the pregenerated character as well as their own character, or the GM can allow the group as a whole to choose the pregenerated character’s actions.</p>
<h3>No Character-versus-Character Combat</h3>
<p>The motto of the Pathfinder Society is “Explore, report, cooperate.” In keeping with the “cooperate” theme, do not engage in character-versus-character conflict. Accidental friendly fire can happen (due to missed attack rolls or other factors), but players must obtain the consent of other players before deliberately including fellow PCs in damaging effects. In such cases, the damage dealer should offer to assist with necessary healing costs. This rule does not apply in situations where a character is not acting of their own free well, such as if they’re being mind-controlled by an NPC and forced to attack a fellow Pathfinder.</p>
<h2>After the Adventure</h2>
<p>Upon completing an adventure, you’ll receive a Chronicle sheet from the GM. This sheet is a reflection of your accomplishments and includes a recap of your adventure; a log of the Experience Points, treasure access, and wealth gained; and a special boon reflecting your experiences in the adventure. If you created your own character, this Chronicle sheet applies to that character, and you may wish to record the Experience Points you gained, the wealth you spent and earned, and items you bought on your character sheet. If you played a pregenerated character, this Chronicle sheet will apply to the first character you create.</p>
<p>As a player, you are expected to keep accurate, up-to-date records of your characters and bring your Chronicle sheets to every Pathfinder Society event or session. If you don’t bring your Chronicle sheets for a character, you will be unable to play that character, though you can play another character or a pregenerated character of an appropriate level instead. We suggest keeping everything in a binder with an individual folder for each character.</p>
<p>See <a href="#chronicle-sheets-and-record-keeping">Chronicle Sheets and Recordkeeping</a>  for information on filling out Chronicle sheets and <a href="#negative effects">Negative Effects</a> for how to resolve negative effects at the end of an adventure.</p>
<p>If you haven’t registered for organized play at <a href="https://paizo.com/"><strong>paizo.com</strong></a>, remember to do so now!</p>
<h3>Replaying Adventures</h3>
<p>Generally you can receive up to two Chronicle sheets for a given adventure, one for playing an adventure and one for running the same adventure as a GM. Some adventures have the “replayable” tag and can be replayed multiple times. For more information on replayable scenarios, see <a href="#replaying-adventures">Replaying Adventures</a>.</p>
<h3>Playtest Points</h3>
<p>If you already have points or boons accrued during a playtest, see <a href="#special-rewards">Special Rewards</a> for information on redeeming playtest points and using playtest boons.</p>


	<div style="page-break-after: always;   page-break-inside: avoid;"></div>
		<a name="wopf"><h1>World of Pathfinder Society  </h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
		<p>The world of Pathfinder and of Pathfinder Society is a world called Golarion. The Age of Lost Omens below provides a basic introduction to the setting; you can learn more about Golarion from Chapter 8 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>, from upcoming Lost Omens setting books, and from the <a href="https://pathfinderwiki.com/">Pathfinder Wiki</a>.</p><p><span id="more-473"></span></p><h2 id="pathfinder-society">What Is The Pathfinder Society?</h2><p>Your character is a member of an in-game organization known as the Pathfinder Society. Pathfinder agents are adventurers who travel throughout the world, exploring new places and chronicling both history and modern lore. The most significant and exciting Pathfinder missions earn a spot in the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>, an ongoing series of journals that are copied and spread far and wide to share the Society’s discoveries with the world. Pathfinders agents come from all over the world and from all walks of life; anyone willing to work together with other agents to pursue the Society’s aims is welcome to try to join the organization. Together, these tenets are captured in the Pathfinder motto: “Explore, report, cooperate.”</p><h3 id="pathfinder-society-training">Training</h3><p>Most prospective Pathfinders start their careers by traveling to the Society’s headquarters, the Grand Lodge, to receive training. This training program ensures that new agents are equipped with the skills they need to handle perilous situations, and that they are well-versed in the art of working together as a team. The training program is organized into the three Pathfinder Schools: the Spells, the Scrolls, and the Swords. The Spells, overseen by Master of Spells Sorrina Westyr, trains agents in matters concerning magic, from honing their own abilities to cast spells and rituals to teaching them how to recognize and counter spellwork that they may find in the field. The Scrolls focuses on scholarship and study, teaching agents a wide array of useful knowledge from any discipline that intrigues them, including how to properly document their discoveries. Finally, the Swords gives agents physical training, helping them improve their martial prowess and teaching them survival skills, from disarming traps and sneaking to climbing and swimming. Newly appointed Head Initiate Janira Gavix helps trainees thrive during their education and during their first few years as full agents.</p><p>A rare few Pathfinders skip the usual training process, having already distinguished themselves in some way that proves that they have what it takes to be a Pathfinder. These agents receive field commissions, which allow them to engage in a far shorter training process. Field commissioned agents have fewer responsibilities back at the Grand Lodge, but they also tend to receive less material support from the Pathfinder Society than agents who built connections there during their years of practice and study. Once an agent has completed their training, they have the freedom to travel the world and seek out places to explore.</p><h3 id="pathfinder-society-leadership">Leadership</h3><p>Most Pathfinder missions are assigned by a group of leaders known as venture-captains. Venture-captains typically spend a lot less time in the field than adventuring agents, instead spending their time managing a lodge. In the process, venture-captains watch for leads for suitable missions, handle logistics and paperwork, and scout out nearby Pathfinders who may be interested in the adventure opportunities they have to offer.  At the top of the Pathfinder Society’s hierarchy are the Decemvirate, also known as the Ten. Most of the members of The Ten hide their identities behind magical masks, but recent rumors indicate that one of the Ten has decided to go public with her identity.</p><h3 id="pathfinder-society-symbols">Symbols</h3><p>The official symbol of the Pathfinder Society is the glyph of the open road, a symbol depicting a stylized intersection of two roads under a star. Most Pathfinders carry a special type of magical compass known as a <em>wayfinder</em>; because these compasses are hard to find outside of the Society, they serve as badges of membership.</p>

			<a name=playbasic><h1>Player Basics  </h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
			

<p>This guide is for players who are already registered for organized play and have played through their first game.</p>
<p><span id="more-459"></span></p>
<h2>Characters</h2>
<p>In Pathfinder Society games, you can either use a pregenerated character or create your own character.</p>
<h3>Creating a Character</h3>
<p>The process of creating a character follows the guidelines in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>, with a few additional campaign-specific benefits. <a href="#character-creation">Character Creation</a> contains step-by-step instructions to help you create your own Pathfinder Society character and explains the aforementioned benefits. Read these rules carefully, as they ensure that characters are suitable for the organized play campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Resources:</strong> All of the ancestries, backgrounds, and classes from the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> are available to you when creating a character. Some ancestries and options from other books may need to be accessed with <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Points</a> before you can use them in organized play. (See also <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.)</p>
<p>Remember to <a href="#register">register your character</a>  at <a href="https://paizo.com/"><strong>paizo.com</strong></a>!</p>
<h3 id="pregenerated-characters">Pregenerated Characters</h3>
<p>If you don’t have time to create a new character or want to try out a new character class, you can use a pregenerated character, also called a pregen. The Pathfinder Society Roleplaying Guild offers free pregenerated characters based on Pathfinder’s iconic characters, available at <a href="http://paizo.com/products/btq01zt5?Community-Use-Package-PF2E-Iconics-Pregenerated-Characters">paizo.com</a> or from your local event coordinator.  The following rules apply when playing pregenerated characters.</p>
<h4>Choose a Character to Receive Credit</h4>
<p>Before the game, you must choose which of your characters to assign the credit for playing this adventure to. (If you haven’t created your own character yet, you’ll assign it to the first character that you create.) Credit from a 1st-level pregenerated character can be assigned only to a 1st-level character. Credit for playing a higher-level pregenerated character must be assigned to a Pathfinder Society character of a lower level than the pregenerated character.</p>
<h4>Negative Effects</h4>
<p>During play, your pregenerated character may be afflicted with negative effects such as a curse, a disease, or even death. The pregenerated character must clear and resolve these negative effects before the end of the adventure; otherwise, they affect the Pathfinder Society character that’s receiving credit for the adventure. A few adventures, such as <em>Origins of the Open Road</em>, have special rules for pregenerated characters that provide alternate means to clear negative effects.</p>
<ul><li>After applying Pathfinder Society character resources, you can use the pregenerated character’s funds to pay for these spellcasting services. If sold to pay for removing a negative effect, a 1st-level character’s gear is worth 7.5 gold pieces, a 3rd-level character’s gear is worth 37.5 gold pieces, and a 5th-level character’s gear is worth 135 gold pieces.</li>
<li>The character can use the gold and Fame that she has earned on the Chronicle sheet for the current adventure to help pay for removing negative effects.</li>
<li>If more resources are needed to pay for the cost of removing negative effects, players at the table can contribute some of their own gold pieces, but they are not required to.</li>
</ul><h4>Apply Credit</h4>
<p>You may apply a pregenerated character’s Chronicle sheet to one of your Pathfinder Society characters once your Pathfinder Society character reaches the level of the pregenerated character used to play through it. For example, if you played a 5th-level pregenerated character, you would apply the credit once your character reaches 5th level.</p>
<ul><li>Apply the Chronicle sheets for eligible adventures in the order in which they were played. For each one, add the rewards earned (Experience Points, gold pieces, Fame, boons etc.) to your character, along with any negative effects that weren’t removed from the pregenerated character. This character is also now able to buy any items listed on that Chronicle sheet.</li>
<li>If you apply credit for multiple adventures at once, your Pathfinder Society character might advance multiple levels. The character’s level cannot exceed the tier range of any Chronicle sheets applied to them.</li>
<li>You can apply credit from a higher-tier adventure to a 1st-level Pathfinder Society character. When doing so, you gain only the gold appropriate to a 1st-level character. You do not benefit from any boons until your Pathfinder Society character reaches the minimum level listed on the Chronicle sheet, unless otherwise noted.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Downtime: </strong>Pregenerated characters can use <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>.</p>
<h2>Before the Adventure Session</h2>
<p>At the game table, introduce yourself to the other players and the Game Master. Take this time to determine which character within the adventure’s subtier (range of levels) you want to play—this can be a character you created or a pregenerated character. The GM will also pass around a sign-in sheet to record your character’s name, level, <a href="#factions">faction</a>, and Organized Play ID (if you don’t have an Organized Play ID yet, your GM can assign you one).  During this time, you also need to decide whether you are using <a href="#after-the-adventure-advancement-speed">Standard Advancement or Slow Advancement.</a>  (Slow advancement lets you play more scenarios with that same character before you reach the maximum level; standard advancement helps you level up and become powerful more quickly).</p>
<h2 id="negative effects">Negative Effects</h2>
<p>The Pathfinder Society has resources to take care of its members, and many of the possible negative effects an adventurer can be subject to during an adventure are assumed to be taken care of during Downtime. The exceptions to this are death, permanent petrification or polymorph effects, curses, and permanent negative conditions (<em>Core Rulebook </em>618–623) acquired during the course of the adventure. These negative effects must be cleared at the end of the adventure or the character must be reported as “dead,” unable to continue adventuring in Pathfinder Society organized play. Most of these negative effects can be cleared by spending Fame for the appropriate service on <a href="#table-all-faction-boon">Table 2: All-Factions Boons</a>.  Other PCs may use their spells, feats, class abilities, or consumables to assist you in recovering from such negative effects, but they aren’t required to.</p>
<h2>Option Rarity and Access</h2>
<p>Some options within the game will have a listed rarity. The categories of rarity are common, uncommon, rare, and unique. Common options from the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are always available for use. Uncommon options typically require a specific condition to be met to take them; this can include taking a specific feat or class feature, acquiring the item during a game and gaining it on a Chronicle sheet, or meeting another access condition (see below). Rare options are incredibly difficult to find or obtain and are generally not available for use in character creation or leveling. Unique options are the rarest of all, with only one existing in all the world, and will almost never be available as player options. Be sure to check Character Options for more information on the availability of options.</p>
<p><strong>Access: </strong>Some uncommon options have an entry labeled “Access.” If you satisfy the access condition by being from the specified region, a member of a particular organization, or meeting some similar requirement, that option is common for you. All characters created for use in Pathfinder Society Organized Play are members of the Pathfinder Society organization in the world of Golarion, so they gain access to options that require membership in the Pathfinder Society.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Equipment</h3>
<p>As you complete adventures, you will gain more wealth that can be used to buy any common item that is no more than 2 levels higher than your current level. Uncommon items may be granted by Chronicle sheets or through other special boons. Characters with the appropriate crafting feats may also be able to obtain formulas for equipment that they can create during <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>.</p>
<h2>Leveling Up</h2>
<p>In Pathfinder Society, characters level up after ever 12 Experience Points earned, instead of every 1,000 Experience Points. Leveling up your character otherwise works normally.</p>
<h2 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h2>
<p>This page details the steps for creating a character for the Pathfinder Society. These steps mirror those in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> with a few additional Roleplaying Guild-specific rules and benefits.</p>
<ol><li>
<h3>Ability Scores</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Generate your Pathfinder Society character’s ability scores using the method detailed on page 20 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Your character may also take two additional ability flaws to gain one additional ability boost as described in the Voluntary Flaws sidebar on page 26 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>.</p>
<ol start="2"><li>
<h3>Ancestry</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Select your character’s ancestry. The ancestry choices offered in the <em>Core Rulebook </em>are always available. Other ancestries may available as <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Point</a> boons or through <a href="#chopt">Character Options.</a></p>
<ol start="3"><li>
<h3>Languages</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Your character gains some languages based on their ancestry, but might speak additional languages depending on their Intelligence or class. All Pathfinder Society characters are literate and speak Common.</p>
<h4>Cultural Languages</h4>
<p><strong>Human:</strong> Humans can speak Common, as well as any other modern human language associated with their ethnicity. Humans gain one additional common language or regional language of their choice. The cultural languages listed below (along with their associated ethnicities) are good choices.</p>
<ul><li>Common (Taldan)</li>
<li>Erutaki (Erutaki)</li>
<li>Hallit (Kellid)</li>
<li>Kelish (Kelishite)</li>
<li>Osiriani (Garundi)</li>

</ul><h4>Bonus Languages</h4>
<p>A character with a high Intelligence score can select bonus languages from the list of modern human languages above or the bonus languages listed in the source for the character’s ancestry.</p>
<ol start="4"><li>
<h3>Background</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Once you’ve chosen your character’s ancestry, it’s time to select their background. All of the backgrounds presented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> starting on page 60 are available for use. Other backgrounds will be available through the <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Point system</a>, or for completing scenarios in prior seasons of the Pathfinder Society Organized Play campaign (See <a href="#legback">Legacy Backgrounds</a>). Backgrounds from other sources will generally be available so long as you own a valid copy of the source, though some exceptions may occur; these exceptions are noted in <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.</p>
<ol start="5"><li>
<h3>Class</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>All of the classes presented in the <em>Core Rulebook</em> are available to characters. Pathfinder Society characters begin at 1st level, though some boons available through the Achievement Point system may allow a character to start at 2nd or 3rd level.</p>
<ol start="6"><li>
<h3>Hit Points</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Your character’s Hit Points are determined by their ancestry, class, Constitution modifier, and level. Each ancestry gives a certain number of Hit Points, as detailed in its entry. This amount is added to the Hit Points granted by the character’s chosen class and their Constitution modifier. At each level after 1st, a character gains the number of Hit Points specified in their class entry.</p>
<ol start="7"><li>
<h3>Skills</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Each class grants a starting proficiency ranks in certain skills at 1st level. Characters with a high Intelligence score are trained in a number of additional skills of their choice, as described in their class entry. Review Chapter 4 of the <em>Core Rulebook </em>for the details of how to assign skill increases and the benefits they grant.</p>
<ol start="8"><li>
<h3>Feats</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Each class grants feats starting at 1st level and at most or all levels thereafter. A character must be the same level as or a higher level than a feat to select it. There are four different types of feats a character gains: ancestry feats, class feats, general feats, and skill feats. Ancestry feats are determined by your ancestry and can be found in the same section as your other ancestry statistics. Class feats are your most powerful feats; they are determined by your character class and presented in the same section. General feats are feats that any character can take, and are located in Chapter 5 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> alongside Skill feats. Skill feats affect a skill in a particular way, usually giving the character more ways to use that skill; some skill feats are available only to characters whose proficiency rank in the skill is expert or greater.</p>
<p>Additional feats can be found in other books, as detailed in <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a>.</p>
<ol start="9"><li>
<h3>Starting Wealth and Equipment</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>All characters in Pathfinder Society begin with 15 gold pieces (150 silver pieces) that can be spent on starting gear. Chapter 6 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> has a wide array of useful starting gear. Page 289 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> includes class kits, prebuilt selections of gear tailored to each of the core classes. You can also spend your wealth to purchase any common item of your level or lower, including common items without a listed level.</p>
<ol start="10"><li>
<h3>Alignment</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Select one of the following alignments for your character (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 29): chaotic good, chaotic neutral, lawful good, lawful neutral, neutral, or neutral good. Players may not play evil characters. When choosing an alignment, be sure it satisfies any alignment requirements for your character’s class.</p>
<ol start="11"><li>
<h3>Religion</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Characters can worship any deity listed in the table of gods on page 437 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em> or any other source listed in <a href="#chopt">Character Options</a> , so long as their alignment matches one of the deity’s listed follower alignments. Champions and clerics must choose a valid deity, though other classes can worship one of the faiths and philosophies presented on page 440 of <em>Core Rulebook</em> or another legal source. Characters can also be agnostic or atheist.</p>
<p>Some characters may revere deities they do not worship. Revering a deity means that your character may do things like wearing the deity’s holy symbol, attending the deity’s religious services, or performing other acts of obeisance that aren’t rewarded with spells or divine powers. For example, many druids revere Gozreh a deity of nature, but their primal magic is granted by Nature itself and does not come from Gozreh. A character may revere as many deities as they wish, but can worship and receive power from only one.</p>
<ol start="12"><li>
<h3>Age</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Characters must be at least young adults (see the Physical Description section for your selected ancestry in Chapter 2 of the <em>Core Rulebook</em>), as particularly young characters can change the tone of some of the game’s threats.</p>
<ol start="13"><li>
<h3>Finishing Details</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Now it’s time to fine-tune your character’s appearance and personal history, including their region of origin,</p>
<p>preferred gender pronouns, and other particulars. Make a few notes on your character’s appearance that you can use to describe your character. Read through <a href="#wopf">The World of Pathfinder Society</a> for information on the campaign setting and consider using it to inform your character’s background.</p>
<p>You’ll also need a miniature or pawn to represent your character—Pathfinder uses a standard 1-inch grid to determine movement and tactical positioning in combat, so you need a physical representation of your character to use on the grid. Paizo produces a wide range of Pathfinder Pawns and also works with Reaper Miniatures and WizKids to offer a wide variety of gaming miniatures, so you can find just the right figure for your character.</p>
<ol start="14"><li>Pathfinder Training</li>
</ol><p>Each Pathfinder Society character receives 3 networking points to represent the connections they have made in the three <a href="#pathfinder-society-training">Pathfinder Schools</a>: Spells, Scrolls, or Swords. They can invest these points among the schools, or can forgo these points and instead be a “field commissioned agent.”  <wbr/>Each of these choices bestows different benefits as described below in <a href="#pathfinder-training">Pathfinder Training.</a></p>
<ol start="15"><li>
<h3>Factions</h3>
</li>
</ol><p>Finally, choose a faction for your character to join. The factions represent different approaches to being a Pathfinder and priorities during missions. Joining a faction costs a boon, but your first such boon is free. Currently, four major factions and two minor factions are available.</p>
<h4>Major Factions</h4>
<p>The four main factions are summarized below. Detailed descriptions of these factions, as well as benefits of membership and faction goals, can be found in <a href="#factions">Factions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Envoy’s Alliance:</strong> Being a Pathfinder is dangerous work. Travel comes with its own dangers, traps seem to be everywhere, and just about everything seems ready to kill aspiring Pathfinder agents. Envoys’ Alliance aims to bolster the Society’s ranks and represent its members, making the Society ever stronger, better trained, and better supported.</p>
<p><strong>Grand Archive:</strong> Archaeology is a destructive science, and adventurers tend to be more destructive than most. If the Society is to uphold its mandate to study and preserve the past, then documentation and academic rigor are key. Yet members of the Grand Archive do not limit themselves to Absalom’s libraries; these bold explorers voyage to the most exciting sites to chronicle the past and share what they learn with the world.</p>
<p><strong>Horizon Hunters:</strong> The Horizon Hunters faction is home to those who carry on the proud tradition of ascending the highest peaks, plumbing the darkest depths, and seeing what lies over the next hill. And as sweet as it is to discover a lost ruin or unknown vista, it’s all the better to tell wild tales about the experience and revel in the admiration of peers—particularly if your deeds are immortalized in the <em>Pathfinder Chronicles</em>, a widely distributed record of the greatest Pathfinders’ achievements and discoveries.</p>
<p><strong>Vigilant Seal:</strong> While the Pathfinder Society’s motto is “Explore, Report, Cooperate”, members of the Vigilant Seal have their own three-part motto: “Protect, Contain, Destroy.” Members of the Vigilant Seal seek to ensure that ancient evils uncovered during their expeditions are properly dealt with—they protect ancient sites, contain possible threats, and destroy dangerous evils that can’t be safely contained.</p>
<h4>Minor Factions</h4>
<p>The two minor factions are summarized below. Detailed descriptions of the factions, as well as benefits of membership and faction goals, can be found in <a href="#factions">Factions</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Radiant Oath:</strong> Pathfinders have a track record for thwarting evil, lending a helping hand, and presenting the Pathfinders as upstanding folk wherever they go. For the Radiant Oath, this benevolence extends beyond incidental assistance. Instead, the faction sees the Society’s broad reach as an excellent vector for assisting others the world over. Those who join the Radiant Oath swear simple vows to assist others, expanding on these promises the more they serve the faction.</p>
<p><strong>Verdant Wheel:</strong> Nature enthusiasts of all stripes—from grizzled trackers to bright-eyed ecologists to tenacious druids—gravitate to the Society for opportunities to witness natural wonders, catalog new species, and better protect the world’s pristine realms. The Verdant Wheel has a particular fondness for sensing patterns and cycles, such as that of creation and destruction, as exemplified by new growth sprouting from a fire-ravaged field. Yet even those intent on preserving that which exists can find a welcome home here.</p>
<h2 id="pathfinder-training">Pathfinder Training</h2>
<p>Although drawn from diverse backgrounds and regions, the vast majority of Pathfinders undergo approximately 3 years of training at the Grand Lodge, in the process learning the key skills they need to survive on the road, explore dangerous sites, and understand their discoveries. The deans of the Society’s three schools +oversee this training, each promoting particular techniques tied to their respective schools: the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords. <strong>Kreighton Shaine</strong> (CG male elf loremaster) is the Master of Scrolls, who instructs his pupils in history, languages, sciences, and academic esoterica. <strong>Sorrina Westyr</strong> (N female oread priest of Nethys) is the Master of Spells, who lectures on magical basics, overcoming supernatural hazards, and the proper handling of artifacts. And finally, <strong>Marcos Farabellus</strong> (CG male human commander) is the Master of Swords, who guides initiates through endurance drills, teaches the finer arts of infiltration, and ensures each Pathfinder has enough combat training to stay safe in dangerous lands.</p>
<p>Each Pathfinder initiate must attain a certain level of proficiency in all three schools’ teachings in order to graduate as a field agent, yet most specialize in one of the schools’ curricula and build life-long professional contacts with like-minded scholars. Over the course of their career, a Pathfinder regularly receives gifts from colleagues in the form of potions, scrolls, experimental alchemy, and more—in practice, this provides PCs one or more consumable items at the beginning of each scenario. In return, the field agent’s expected to return the favor by contributing labor, teaching expertise, lab assistance, or more between missions, reinforcing these professional relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Consumable Items:</strong> The universal benefit of this training is creating a network of colleagues and contacts who regularly provide you consumable items. At the beginning of each adventure, your character receives a consumable item of their level or lower from a list of options; they have access to the items of the appropriate level in <a href="#pathfinder-training-table-all-schools-items">Table 1: All-Schools Items</a> as well as the options on the tables for any of their chosen schools. If not used by the end of the adventure, the item is returned to the character’s contacts.</p>
<h3 id="pathfinder-training-assigning-points">Assigning Points</h3>
<p>When creating your character, you gain 3 networking points to distribute among the Scrolls, Spells, and Swords schools. These represent the amount of effort and attention your character dedicated to those schools while training as an initiate. Once assigned, these cannot be changed except through retraining (a process that takes 14 days to reassign all of the networking points and their associated benefits). The benefits you gain from each school depends on the number of networking points you invest in it, and the benefits are cumulative.</p>
<p><strong>1 Point:</strong> When selecting your free consumable item at the beginning of the adventure, you can choose one of the items on the school’s list of options.</p>
<p><strong>2 Points:</strong> You become trained in one of the Lore skills associated with that school, listed below. At 5th level, you gain a bonus skill feat selected from the list below.</p>
<p><em>Scrolls:</em> For the Lore skill, choose from Accounting Lore, Library Lore, or Scribing Lore. For the bonus skill feat, choose from Assurance, Automatic Knowledge, Multilingual, or Streetwise.</p>
<p><em>Spells:</em> For the Lore skill, choose from Academia Lore, Architecture Lore, or Herbalism Lore. For the bonus skill feat, choose from Arcane Sense, Assurance, Quick Identification, or Recognize Spell.</p>
<p><em>Swords:</em> For the Lore skill, choose from Gladiatorial Lore, Scouting Lore, or Warfare Lore. For the bonus skill feat, choose from Cat Fall, Experienced Smuggler, Forager, or Hefty Hauler.</p>
<p><strong>3 Points:</strong> When selecting your free consumable item at the beginning of the adventure, you gain both one item of your level or lower from the options available, and you gain a second item whose item level is no greater than half your level (minimum 1).</p>

</tr></tbody></table><h3 id="pathfinder-training-field-commissioned-agents">Field-Commissioned Agents</h3>
<p>Not everyone goes through this training. Exceptional explorers and scholars sometimes attract the Society’s attention through their independent accomplishments, and venture-captains have the authority to grant these adventurers field commissions. This waives the usual training period, but what the field-commissioned agents recoup in free time, they lose in networking opportunities.</p>
<p>If your character is a field-commissioned agent, they do not get any points to assign to a school. At the beginning of each adventure, the agent receives a consumable item of half their level or lower from Table XX: All Schools; at 1st level, the character does not receive any such consumable items. However, the character’s fewer obligations afford them additional free time, increasing the amount of Downtime they receive after each adventure by 50% (12 Downtime days earned after a scenario rather than 8).</p>
<h2>Rebuilding Your Character</h2>
<p>You may find that there are aspects of your character where you’re not entirely sure about your decisions, such as the ancestry or class feat you chose. Don’t worry! While your character is 1st level, you can rebuild as often as you need to, changing any of these choices. Until you play a game in which your character has 12 or more XP, you can freely rebuild your character completely except for Reputation earned and character number. Once you begin a session as a second level character, you still have options for changing your character’s choices. In addition to <a href="#downtime-retraining">retraining</a>, in which your character spends their Downtime to swap out individual features of their build, you can earn boons that allow you to rebuild your character more extensively.</p>
<h2 id="player-rewards">Player Rewards</h2>
<p>You can earn rewards from the adventures you play in and are Game Master for, as well as for other special circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="player-rewards-boons">Boons</h3>
<p>Boons are small in-game rewards given for a variety of reasons, including attendance at events, holidays, supporting charities, and special occasions. Some examples of boon types are listed in <a href="#boons-boon-slots">Boon Slots </a>below.</p>
<p><strong>Achievement Points: </strong>Typically, when a Pathfinder Society game you play is reported online, Achievement Points will be credited to your Paizo account that can be redeemed for special boons, such as new playable ancestries or access to rewards from a region other than the one you chose during character creation. (See <a href="#special-rewards-achievement-points">Achievement Points</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Chronicle Sheet:</strong> Every Chronicle sheet includes a special boon that grants a benefit unique to the adventure or product that granted it. Chronicle sheet boons generally need to be slotted (declared active) before their benefits can be applied, though some boons are slotless and may be used as long as you have the physical copy of the Chronicle sheet present. See <a href="#boons-boon-slots"><strong>Boon Slots</strong></a> below.</p>
<p><strong>Discounts:</strong> Some boons provide a discount on the cost in Fame or gold pieces required to purchase another boon or item. Unless otherwise noted, only one boon that provides any discount can be applied to any one purchase. This prevents multiple discounts from reducing a purchase’s cost by an unreasonable amount.</p>
<h3 id="boons-boon-slots">Boon Slots</h3>
<p>Each character has five boon slots available to “slot” (declare active) and use the boons they have acquired. A character chooses which boons to slot after the GM complete the mission briefing for their adventure (or introduction in the case of some Pathfinder Adventures and Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes). Three of these slots are generic and can be used to slot any kind of boon other than faction and advanced boons. Faction boons indicate the faction you have chosen to represent for this mission, which can impact the Fame you gain and possibly other elements of the scenario. Advanced boons are rare and powerful, and are typically gained through participation in a special event (such as a game with unique, hidden conditions or a special promotional event, like a playtest).</p>
<p><strong>Boon Traits:</strong> Many boons have one or more traits, some of which indicate the boon’s flavor and others which convey special rules for using the boon. Future rewards or effects may also interact with particular types of boons in special ways. The following are the current boon types:</p>
<ul><li>An <strong>advanced</strong> boon is typically more powerful or complex than other boons, and it can be slotted only in the advanced boon slot (not a generic boon slot). As a result, you can only use one advanced boon at a time.</li>
<li>An <strong>ally</strong> boon represents an NPC who accompanies and assists your character. Unless you choose to purposefully endanger that NPC (an act that might result in your gaining Infamy, depending on the circumstances) or an effect specifically targets an Ally boon, this NPC stays out of harm’s way, does not interfere with combat, and takes up no space during encounters.</li>
<li>A <strong>Downtime</strong> boon provides you some special way to use the Downtime you earn at the end of the adventure.</li>
<li>A <strong>faction</strong> boon indicates which faction you are representing during an adventure. You can slot a faction boon only in the faction slot (not in the generic or advanced slots).</li>
<li>A <strong>heroic</strong> boon influences how you use Hero Points or grants an additional effect when you use a Hero Point.</li>
<li>An <strong>item</strong> boon represents a special piece of equipment you’ve acquired or a special way that you’ve modified a piece of equipment you already have.</li>
<li>A <strong>limited-use</strong> boon can only be used a limited number of times before it is expended. Some boons have both a constant benefit as well as a benefit with limited uses, and the constant benefit can still be used once all of the boon’s limited uses have been expended.</li>
<li>A <strong>mentor</strong> boon grants a benefit to PCs whose level is lower than yours, representing your mentorship of your less experienced comrades.</li>
<li>A <strong>promotional</strong> boon represents a special benefit for bringing specific Pathfinder- or campaign-branded gear (like a Pathfinder Society shirt or a Campaign Service Award coin) with you to the gaming table. As a general rule, you can slot only a single promotional boon.</li>
<li>A <strong>property</strong> boon represents a building, large vehicle, or other asset that your character owns or can use.</li>
<li>A <strong>service</strong> boon represents an instantaneous, one-time favor or action performed for your character, after which the boon is expended and grants no further benefit.</li>
<li>A <strong>slotless</strong> boon does not need to be slotted to grant its effect. Some slotless boons modify existing boons you already have.</li>
<li>A <strong>social</strong> boon represents a special affiliation, membership, friendship, or favor.</li>
<li>A <strong>trial</strong> boon represents an ongoing difficulty that is difficult to end. A trial boon typically requires that you slot it before you can slot any other boons, and trial boons typically have a special condition you must fulfill to end them.</li>
</ul><h2 id="downtime">Downtime</h2>
<p>Upon completing an adventure that grants XP, you gain days of Downtime that can be spent in a variety of ways. (See Organized Play Basics, under <a href="#downtime">Downtime</a>, for how many days each type of adventure grants.)  These include attempting checks to Earn Income and Craft items, as well as retraining. Certain other activities may be available depending on boons or other circumstances as described in the adventure. Typically, once you have begun a Downtime task you cannot begin another until the first task is completed, though some exceptions exist (see <a href="#downtime-crafting">Crafting</a> and <a href="#downtime-retraining">Retraining</a> below). You can’t save up Downtime from multiple Chronicle sheets, but you can start or continue an activity such as Crafting an item that requires multiple adventures’ worth of Downtime to complete</p>
<p><strong id="downtime-earn-income">Earn Income: </strong>Earning Income is the most common Downtime activity. If you are using your Downtime for any other purposes, they must be completed first before you attempt your check to Earn Income. For each 8 day unit of Downtime you spend (including units where you complete multiple activities, such as spending 7 days retraining and then 1 day Earning Income), you attempt one check to Earn Income, using the result to calculate your total earnings for that block of Downtime. The Task Level of you Earn Income check is equal to your level – 2 (minimum 0) by default (GMs should check <strong>Table</strong> <strong>10–5: DCs by Level </strong>on page 503 of the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em> to calculate the DC), though some boons may allow you to attempt checks against higher-level tasks as a special reward. A check to Earn Income does not carry beyond the 8-day cycle for which you attempt the check.</p>
<p><strong id="downtime-crafting">Crafting: </strong>Some characters may choose to spend their time Crafting a piece of equipment. This works as described on pages 503–504 the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Use the DC based on the level of the item from <strong>Table 10–5</strong> for common items, applying the hard DC adjustment from <strong>Table 10–6</strong> to the DC for uncommon items and the very hard DC adjustment for rare items. You can Craft uncommon or rare items only if you find their formulas. Crafting requires that you spend the first 4 days of a block of Downtime preparing before attempting your check to Craft; unlike Earning Income, Crafting tasks can be continued across as many Downtime days as necessary until the item is completed or you pay the remainder of the Price required to finish the item.</p>
<p><strong id="downtime-retraining">Retraining:</strong> You can also use Downtime to retrain certain abilities and swap them out for new ones. This works as described in the <em>Core Rulebook</em>. Retraining a feat, skill increase, or a spell in your spell repertoire takes 7 days of Downtime, while retraining a selectable class feature, such as a druid order, takes 28 days. If you level up when still in the process of retraining a selectable class feature such as a druid order, you may choose an option that would be legal for the new order you are retraining to, though you may not use that ability until the retraining is complete.</p>
<p>For example, suppose Lini is 5th level and has decided that she would prefer to return Droogami to the wild and master the arts of a storm order druid instead. She begins the retraining process but will not complete it until she has completed her first scenario as a 6th-level character; Lini may select the Storm Retribution feat as her 6th-level feat, but cannot use it until she completes her retraining and becomes a storm order druid. Similarly, any feats Lini has that were contingent on her previous order cease being functional once Lini has attained her new order; for example if Lini had chosen Mature Animal Companion as her 4th-level feat but no longer had the Animal Companion feat after retraining to become a storm order druid, the feat would simply be nonfunctional until she either gained an animal companion or retrained Mature Animal Companion for another feat.</p>
<p>You can also retrain your <a href="#pathfinder-training">Pathfinder training</a> —that is, your selection between Spells, Scrolls, Swords, or field-commissioned agent. Doing so takes 14 days of Downtime, during which you adjust your level of affiliation with these aspects of the Pathfinder Society.</p>

<p>Most adventures grant your character Experience Points (XP) for completing them. Whenever your character gains 12 XP, they reach a new level and gain additional benefits and abilities as described in the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. Quests typically grant 1 XP, and scenarios typically grant 4. Sanctioned Pathfinder Adventures, Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes, and Pathfinder Modules volumes typically run much longer than a scenario and grant more XP; for example, a Chronicle sheet for a single Adventure Path volume is likely to grant 12 XP.</p>
<h2>Fame and Reputation</h2>
<p>Fame represents your standing within the Pathfinder Society. You accrue Fame every time you complete a quest, scenario, or other sanctioned adventure. You’ll accrue it at roughly the same pace as XP, though these two numbers will not necessarily be identical. Reputation measures your standing within a faction, and you can earn it by completing faction missions in certain scenarios. Reputation gives you access to different levels of <a href="#factionboons">faction rewards</a> , while Fame is primarily used for two purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Purchasing Faction Boons:</strong> You can use Fame to purchase <a href="#factionboons">boons</a>  from any factions with which you have Reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving Negative Effects:</strong> The Pathfinder Society has resources to take care of its members. To represent this, you can use Fame to resolve negative effects your character is suffering from, such as death, permanent petrification or polymorph effects, curses, and permanent negative conditions (<em>Core Rulebook </em>618–623). The Fame costs for the appropriate services are listed on <a href="#table-all-faction-boon">Table 2: All-Factions Boons</a>.</p>
<h2>Wealth</h2>
<p>Gold is the primary form of currency available to PCs for making purchases in-game. The gold you gain and spend during each adventure is tracked on that adventure’s Chronicle sheet.</p>
<h2>Hero Points</h2>
<p>In addition to the Hero Point you start each game with, the GM may award you Hero Points during play for particularly heroic deeds. You can spend Hero Points to reroll checks or even avoid death (<em>Core Rulebook</em> 467).</p>
<h2>Retail Incentive Program</h2>
<p>Pathfinder Society Organized Play rewards players who show their support by purchasing and using items featuring campaign insignia, faction logos, or Pathfinder branding. If you display any of the merchandise described above at the beginning of an adventure, your character gains one additional common consumable from their associated <a href="#pathfinder-training">Pathfinder School</a>(s) lists  (Spells, Swords, Scrolls, or All Schools) with a level no greater than half their character’s (minimum 1) for use during that adventure.</p>

<p>Factions offer a variety of rewards. These a PC can access by gaining Reputation with a particular faction and then spending Fame to purchase specific boons. In addition to faction-specific rewards, there are numerous generic rewards that are accessible to all factions based on the amount of Reputation a PC's earned. The rewards take the form of boons, which follow the same rules as those found in the <a href="#player-rewards-boons">Boons</a> section.  You can slot only one boon with the promotional trait at the same time.</p>
<p><span id="more-476"></span></p>
<p>The first Faction Champion boon you select is free. You can select free rewards at any time, even before you play your first adventure.</p>
<p><strong id="reputation-tiers">Reputation Tiers:</strong> By representing a faction during adventures or participating in adventures vital to a faction's interests, a PC gains Reputation with that faction. The greater a PC's Reputation with a faction, the more respected and influential they are with that faction, represented by their Reputation Tier. These tiers are numbered 0 through 4, with a Reputation Tier of 0 representing no relationship with the faction, and a Reputation Tier of 4 representing the height of prestige within the faction. To advance to a higher Reputation Tier, a PC must increase their Reputation for that faction to the values listed in the following table.</p>
<p>Major factions include rewards for all five Reputation Tiers, whereas minor factions typical have rewards only for Reputation Tiers 0–3.</p>

<p>The following list presents rewards available to all factions.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> To calculate your current Reputation Tier for the purpose of purchasing rewards listed in <strong>Table 2: All Factions Boons</strong>, add up your Reputation from all factions and reference table 1.</p>
<p>For example, a character with 11 Reputation with the Vigilant Seal and 27 with the Envoys' Alliance has a total Reputation of 38 and therefore qualifies as Reputation Tier 2 when accessing the All Factions rewards.</p>

<p class="boondetails"><strong>Prerequisites</strong> Envoys' Alliance Tier 2, you have a <em>wayfinder</em></p>
<p class="boondetails"><strong>Cost</strong> 2 Fame</p>
<p class="boondetails">You have modified your <em>wayfinder</em> to resonate with your allies' actions, allowing you to better help them in times of need. When you slot this boon, you apply its benefits to one <em>wayfinder</em> in your possession, granting you a special free action ability when the <em>wayfinder</em> is invested and in your possession.</p>
<p class="boondetails">You can activate this ability as a free action before you Aid an ally. If you roll a success on the check to Aid, you instead get a critical success.</p>
<p class="boondetails">You can safely use this benefit once per adventure. You can attempt to use it a second time, overcharging the <em>wayfinder</em> at the risk of destroying it. When you do so, roll a DC 10 flat check. On a success, the <em>wayfinder</em> is broken. On a failure, the <em>wayfinder</em> is destroyed. If anyone tries to overcharge a <em>wayfinder</em> that's already been overcharged, the item is automatically destroyed (even if it has been repaired) and does not provide the activated benefit.</p>

<p class="boondetails"><strong>Cost</strong> Varies</p>
<p class="boondetails">Pathfinders often find strange treasures for which they might not have any use, yet one of their colleagues would benefit. When you acquire this boon, select one uncommon, rare, or unique character option to which you've gained access through an adventure's Chronicle sheet (e.g., a boon that allows you to acquire a special animal companion or purchase a special magic item). Choose another of your characters. That character gains access to that special option instead, though they may only use the option once their level equals or exceeds the lowest level able to play the Chronicle sheet's adventure (e.g., 5th level for Tier 5–8). On the Chronicle sheet, write “Bequeathed” and the recipient character's number next to the option. You no longer have access to that option (and must sell it back if you acquired the option and would no longer qualify for it).</p>
<p class="boondetails">The cost of this boon is 4 Fame for an uncommon option, 8 Fame for a rare option, and 12 Fame for a unique option.</p>

Choose an additional ethnicity, such as Varisian or Garundi. In addition to the ethnicity you selected at character creation, you are also treated as a member of this additional ethnicity for the purpose of fulfilling prerequisites and Access conditions.</p>

<p>The following backgrounds are special options available only to players who participated in the First Edition campaign, representing unique character hooks.</p>
<p><span id="more-466"></span></p>
<h3>Early Explorer                     Background</h3>
<p>In the past decade, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with demonic armies, meddled in politics, and more, but you joined the organization before everything seemed so complicated. Whether you’re a dedicated scholar of ruins or an explorer who just longs for months-long expeditions into the wilderness, you’re a Pathfinder to explore, report, and cooperate.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Survival skill and the Pathfinder Society Lore skill. You gain the Forager skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Seasons 0 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Shadow War Survivor       Background</h3>
<p>Countless factions have fought for influence in Absalom for millennia, and for decades these groups worked through the Pathfinder Society to better control the City at the Center of the World. Perhaps you were ones of these agents who clashed with other operatives during the so-called Shadow War. Or you might have been an unintended victim of these clandestine clashes, inspiring you to join the Society and stop the conflict from within. Whatever the reason, navigating the Shadow War has left you politically savvy and informed.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Wisdom or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Society skill and the Absalom Lore skill. You gain the Streetwise skill feat.</p>

<h3>Shadow Lodge Defector  Background</h3>
<p>You were among the Pathfinders recruited by the devious Shadow Lodge, lured in by promises of wealth, reform, justice, or revenge. You might have fought against the Society’s loyal agents, helped sabotage the Pathfinders’ reputation in distant countries, or even infiltrated the far-flung lodges as a spy. You’ve since made peace with and rejoined the Pathfinder Society, yet the underhanded reflexes and skills you learned are hard to forget.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the Lie to Me skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 2 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Ruby Phoenix Enthusiast Background</h3>
<p>Named for the legendary sorcerer Hao Jin, the Ruby Phoenix Tournament occurs once every 10 years in Goka and attracts extraordinary talent from across the world. You might have begun training for the tournament but never participated, or perhaps you entered the tournament only to be defeated by (and inspired to join) the Pathfinder Society. Either way, your dedicated training prepares you for the rigors of the adventuring lifestyle.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Dexterity, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Athletics skill and the Gladiatorial Lore skill. You gain the Combat Climber skill feat. In addition, you gain access to one of the following uncommon monk weapons: kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, or temple sword.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 3 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Thassilonian Delver          Background</h3>
<p>As archaeologists uncovered and explored ever-larger numbers of Thassilonian ruins, you were among the eager explorers who sought out the Runelords’ ancient secrets. You may have been the apprentice to another Pathfinder who perished on an expedition, leaving you their discoveries and notes. Or perhaps you explored several of these sites yourself, quickly learning to parse the arcane secrets before lest the eldritch magic extinguish your life.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Arcana skill and the Thassilonian History Lore skill. You gain the Arcane Sense skill feat. Add Thassilonian to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer                      Background</h3>
<p>For over a century, Mendev led a multinational coalition against ever-growing abyssal invaders in the Worldwound, and the Pathfinder Society aided in the so-called Fifth Crusade that ultimately sealed the planar rift and defeated its demon armies. You might be a hardened recruit who clashed with the demons, or perhaps you were a survivor who lost everything to the fiendish armies and narrowly escaped—or was rescued by Pathfinders. Your exposure to the Worldwound has taught you vital lessons in identifying fiends and their magic.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Strength or Constitution, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Religion skill and the Demon Lore skill. You gain the Recognize Spell skill feat. Add Abyssal to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 5 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Scholar of the Sky Key     Background</h3>
<p>The unfamiliar technology of Numeria’s Silver Mount still baffles Society scholars, yet you are one of the innovators who discovered how to operate a handful of these futuristic tools—possibly after surviving more than a few explosions. The Society might have recruited you for your esoteric abilities, or you might have sought out the Society’s protection in escaping the covetously vile Technic League. Even if your understanding of advanced technology is imperfect, your hard-learned lessons are invaluable in deciphering and repairing gear.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Intelligence, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Crafting skill and the Engineering Lore skill. You gain the Quick Repair skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 6 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Former Aspis Agent          Background</h3>
<p>For more than a century, the Pathfinder Society has clashed with the avaricious and underhanded Aspis Consortium, and several years ago the Society dealt its rival a decisive blow. You may be one of the few survivors of a doomed Aspis expedition, or perhaps you chafed at the Consortium’s villainous practices and defected to the Pathfinders. No matter your reasons, you know how to be efficient and ruthless when the circumstances demand.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Intimidation skill and the Aspis Consortium Lore skill. You gain the Group Coercion skill feat. You gain access to any uncommon options as though you were a member of the Aspis Consortium.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 7 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Savior of Air                         Background</h3>
<p>Upon securing the <em>Untouchable Opal</em>, an artifact of extraordinary power, the Pathfinder Society endeavored to free the benevolent demigod Ranginori, who was trapped within the virtually unbreakable prison. You might have joined the Pathfinder Society in its expeditions to the Elemental Planes, or you might have lived on one of those planes before learning of the Society from these Pathfinder agents. You are no stranger to navigating precarious terrain as a result.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Dexterity or Charisma, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Acrobatics skill, plus either Elemental Lords Lore or a Lore skill related either to one of the Elemental Planes (such as Plane of Air Lore). You gain the Cat Fall skill feat. Add Auran to the list of additional languages you can learn for having a high Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 8 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Faction Opportunist          Background</h3>
<p>As the Pathfinder Society’s influence has grown, so too did many of its factions become wealthier and more powerful. These factions relied on a host of Pathfinders and independent operatives alike to establish trade networks, shape national politics, and more, and you were among the specialists who helped one of these factions realize its goal. These events provided you countless opportunities to develop your own contacts and negotiating skills.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Intelligence or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Diplomacy skill, plus either Guild Lore, Heraldry Lore, or Mercantile Lore. You gain the Hobnobber skill feat.</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 9 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>
<h3>Tapestry Refugee               Background</h3>
<p>Within her magnificent museum demiplane, the sorcerer Hao Jin extracted and preserved countless sites and cultures. The demiplane’s unraveling magic forced the Pathfinder Society to evacuate the many inhabitants recently, and you were among the refugees who returned to the Material Plane after centuries of isolation. Whether you joined the Society out of gratitude, curiosity, or desperation, you are hardened by your harrowing flight from your doomed home.</p>
<p>Choose two ability boosts. One must be to Constitution or Wisdom, and one is a free ability boost.</p>
<p>You’re trained in the Medicine or Stealth skill, plus a Lore skill related to the terrain you lived in while on the demiplane (such as Cave Lore or Desert Lore). You gain the Assurance skill feat with the skill you chose to become trained in (Medicine or Stealth).</p>
<p><strong>Special</strong> You can select this background only if you have earned credit for at least 5 First Edition scenarios from Season 10 of the Pathfinder Society organized play campaign.</p>

		<a name="vol"><h1>Volunteer Coordinators</h1></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#toc">^ back to top</a>
		

<p>To coordinate this pool of global volunteers, Paizo has teamed up with the Organized Play Foundation, a nonprofit charitable organization created to help bring together gamers and to promote education through strategic games. Volunteers with the Organized Play Foundation choose which organized play program, in our case Paizo, and the scope of their activities, anything from a local game store to an entire country or continent, to provide regular gaming opportunities for gamers in each region.</p>
<p>Volunteers, collectively known as Venture-Officers, receive ranks based on their duties and geographical areas of responsibility. The top level of volunteers, Regional Venture-Coordinators, looks after geographical areas. Under them are Venture-Captains, responsible for countries, states, or metropolitan areas. Their right hands, the Venture-Lieutenants, assist in the area's coordination efforts, sometimes belonging to the region and other times being assigned to a city or town. The lowest level, Venture-Agents, coordinate activities in one location, such as a game store, a school, a community center, or a military instillation.</p>
<p>The current roster of Paizo Venture-Officers is online at <a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators"><strong>paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators</strong></a>. Players looking for organized play activities in their area should contact their closest Venture-Officer. If you are unsure who your local Venture-Officer is, find your state or country in the list below and contact the associated Regional Venture-Coordinator.</p>
<p>Anyone may join the Organized Play Foundation as a volunteer. A list of recommended tasks and benefits for each level of Venture-Officer rank is located at <strong><a href="https://paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators/volunteer">paizo.com/organizedplay/coordinators/volunteer</a></strong>If you read the Venture-Officer descriptions and are interested in joining the team, complete the volunteer interest form linked at the bottom of the Organized Play Foundation webpage listed above.
