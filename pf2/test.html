        <p>Running Pathfinder Society games is similar running a
        home campaign, but has some key differences. In addition to
        GM Basics, be sure to familiarize yourself with the
        contents of the 
        Quick Start Guide, 
        Organized Play Basics, and 
        Player Basics. You need to know what players know, what
        their expectations are, and how their characters are
        created, played, and advanced.</p>

        <h1>What Is A Game Master?</h1>

        <p>A Game Master (GM) is the person who adjudicates the
        rules and controls all of the elements of the story and
        world that the players explore. A GM&#8217;s duty is to
        provide a fair and fun game. In Pathfinder Society, a GM
        has a few other duties, listed in Your Duties as a Game
        Master below.</p>

        <h1>Who Can Be A Game Master?</h1>

        <p>Anyone with a valid 
        Organized Play ID&nbsp; can run adventures in
        Pathfinder Society. There are no tests to qualify as a GM,
        nor are there feedback-based rating systems in which GMs
        are ranked by their players. While some players are
        hesitant to transition into the role of Game Master, local
        Pathfinder Society groups and the campaign as a whole
        benefit as the pool of Game Masters increases. In many
        cases, players sitting at a new GM&#8217;s table can offer
        guidance to help build that GM&#8217;s skills and
        confidence, so don&#8217;t be afraid to give it a try and
        give a whole table of players a great Pathfinder Society
        experience.</p>

        <h1>Where Can I Buy Adventures?</h1>

        <p>All available adventures suitable for Pathfinder Society
        can be purchased at <strong>paizo.com</strong>. Anyone
        can purchase an adventure pdf&#8212;all you need is a free
        <strong>paizo.com</strong> account. Scenarios are generally
        released during the last week of each month. At least two
        new scenarios are released each month, with additional
        OP-specific content released periodically throughout the
        year. Pathfinder Adventure Path volumes are produced
        monthly, and Pathfinder Adventures are published several
        times each year. (See 
        Types of Adventures for more about these products.)</p>

        <h1 id="event-coordinator">What is an Event
        Coordinator?</h1>

        <p>An event coordinator is a person who organizes a
        Pathfinder Society event. This event can range in size from
        a single table in a home or game store to a large
        convention with hundreds of tables. GMs can also be event
        coordinators, and they often are&#8212;for example, a GM
        organizing and running their own table is also an event
        coordinator if it&#8217;s the only table.</p>

        <h1 id="your-duties-as-game-master">Your Duties As Game
        Master</h1>

        <p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the following
        duties.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Work with the event coordinator to schedule an event
          for you to GM.</li>

          <li>Prepare an adventure to offer to players, including
          gathering the necessary supplies such as maps,
          miniatures, and reference materials.</li>

          <li>Welcome each player to the table and facilitate
          introductions, and provide a signup sheet to collect
          their character&#8217;s name, level, 
          faction, and Organized Play ID. If any players
          don&#8217;t have an Organized Play ID, you can obtain one
          for them from the event coordinator or you can download a
          set of 10 Organized Play ID numbers on the Create an
          Event page by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of
          the page. Don&#8217;t forget to introduce yourself.</li>

          <li>If time permits, spend a few minutes looking over
          each player&#8217;s character sheet and most recent
          Chronicle sheets for accuracy. If you find any egregious
          issues that you can&#8217;t easily work with the player
          to fix, the player will need to choose a different
          character without such errors or play a pregenerated
          character instead. (See Reviewing Chronicle
          Sheets below.)</li>

          <li>Run the scenario as written and within the time
          constraints of the event.</li>

          <li>Give each player an accurate Chronicle sheet for that
          scenario based on the listed adventure rewards (see
          
          Filling Out a Chronicle Sheet).</li>

          <li>Complete the adventure&#8217;s reporting sheet or an
          alternate reporting sheet provided by your event coordinator. Turn the
          reporting sheet the event coordinator so that she can
          report the event at
          <strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong> in a timely
          fashion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="id=">Your Duties as an Event Coordinator</h1>

        <p>The following duties are universal for event
        coordinators, regardless of the size of the event. If you
        are interested in being the primary organizer for a
        convention or other large event, contact your local
        Venture-Captain&nbsp; for more information.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Select a time and location for your event. If the
          location is not your own home, either reserve space or
          ensure that your tables are welcome at the venue for the
          number of hours needed to run the type of adventures you
          plan to offer.</li>

          <li>Choose what adventures will run at the event.</li>

          <li>Gather GMs and players to fill up your tables. You
          can do this by word of mouth, forums, or tools like
          <strong>warhorn.net</strong>.</li>

          <li>Register your event on paizo.com. First, log on to
          your <strong>paizo.com</strong> account. Then go to
          <strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong>
          and click on Create an Event. Click the Create Your Event
          button near the bottom of the page. This will take your
          new event page. For each section of the page, click the
          edit button to open up text boxes to fill, enter the
          information that is relevant to your event and click save
          changes when you are done.</li>

          <li>If you might have new players at your event, bring
          new Organized Play ID numbers for them. You can download
          a set of 10 Organized Play ID numbers on the Create an
          Event page by clicking on the buttons at the bottom of
          the page. If you need more than 10 Organized Play ID
          numbers for your event, email <strong>organizedplay@paizo.com</strong>.
          Alternatively, ask your GMs to bring their own new
          Organized Play ID numbers.</li>

          <li>Bring a selection of 
          pregenerated characters to your event, covering all
          of the character levels for that are appropriate to the
          adventures being offered. Alternatively, ask your GMs to
          bring their own pregenerated characters.</li>

          <li>After the event, input the reporting data into the
          event on <strong>paizo.com</strong>. For this task, go
          back to the Create an Event page, find your event, and
          click the report button on the right side of the page.
          This will take you to a page that allows you to report
          the information for your event, one table at a time. Full
          instructions for using this reporting form appear at the
          top of the page. For large events, you may wish to share
          the reporting task. To enable other people to assist you
          with reporting event information, go back to your event
          page and enter their user names in the box below the
          Delegated Reporters header.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Reviewing Chronicle Sheets</h1>

        <p>If time permits, GMs and coordinators should spend a few
        minutes reviewing players&#8217; Chronicle sheets at the
        start of an event slot. These reviews can happen for a
        variety of reasons. For example, GMs may need to check to
        the Adventure Summary section to learn what your character
        did in a previous adventure, and GMs and coordinators can
        review Chronicle sheets to ensure that they are filled out
        correctly. These reviews can help ensure that players
        understand the rules of Pathfinder and the Pathfinder
        Society Campaign, as well as catch the errors that
        naturally crop up in the course of play. When reviewing a
        Chronicle sheet, if you notice anything that seems amiss,
        you can ask the player to explain any discrepancies to you.
        Remember that errors are far more likely to be honest
        mistakes than intentional cheating, and that it&#8217;s
        possible that they aren&#8217;t errors at all. And most
        errors turn out to be detrimental to characters, not to
        their advantage!</p>

        <p>When you ask the player about a discrepancy, speak with
        the player calmly, nicely, and with an open mind. Resolve
        any issues as fairly as possible. For example, if the
        character selected an option that they did not have access
        to or that was not available to their character, let them
        pick another option instead. If they did not pay the full
        price for an item they have, they can pay for it in full,
        or, if they haven&#8217;t used it yet, simply remove the
        item from their character&#8217;s gear. If they paid too
        much for an item, refund them the extra they paid in the
        &#8220;items sold&#8221; section of their Chronicle sheet.
        Check with your event coordinator, Venture-Captain, or
        Venture-Lieutenant if you are unsure of how to fix a
        mistake, or if you and the player cannot come to an
        agreement about a fair resolution. Remember that the game
        is supposed to be fun, so waste as little time as possible
        on drama and spend as much time as possible providing an
        exciting, action-packed scenario for your players.</p>

        <h1 id="challenge-points">Challenge Points</h1>

        <p>In a typical home game, the PCs would all be the same
        level and face challenges tailored to their level. In an
        organized play environment, though, there needs to be more
        flexibility to make it easier for players whose characters
        are of different levels to participate in the same
        adventure.</p>

        <p>To determine how to adjust an adventure to accommodate
        different character levels, Pathfinder Society uses a
        system called Challenge Points, in which you assign each PC
        a number of points based on their level and how it fits
        into the adventure tier, add up all of the PCs&#8217;
        points, and compares the sum to a table. Based on the
        outcome, you&#8217;d use either the adventure&#8217;s lower
        or higher subtier, and it might apply a small bonus to the
        enemy creatures and check DCs to simulate a slightly
        higher-level adventure.</p>

        <p>Some adventures have only one subtier. For these
        adventures, use the challenge point system to determine any
        adjustments. If the table would direct you to run the high
        subtier, instead run the adventure with the level bump and
        the 6-player adjustment.</p>

        <p>In the future, some special scenarios will have more
        than two subtiers. When running such a scenario, pick two
        subtiers that are next to each other and that include all
        of your PCs, and determine the appropriate challenge based
        on that. For example, in the case of a Tier 1&#8211;6
        adventure, you could either use subtiers 1&#8211;2 and
        3&#8211;4 and determine difficulty as if it were a Tier
        1&#8211;4 scenario or use subtiers 3&#8211;4 and 5&#8211;6
        as if were a Tier 3&#8211;6 scenario. If all of your
        players are in the same subtier, then it does not matter
        which adjacent subtier you pick&#8212;the system will give
        you the same result.</p>

        <h2>Calculating Challenge Points</h2>

        <p>To calculate the number of Challenge Points the party
        represents, take the following steps.</p>

        <p><strong>1: Record the PCs&#8217; levels.</strong> The
        number of Challenge Points that each PC contributes is
        based only on their character levels.</p>

        <p><strong>2: Convert the PCs&#8217; levels to Challenge
        Points.</strong> and the number of Challenge Points a PC
        contributes depends on whether they are the lowest level in
        that tier, the second-lowest, the second-highest, or the
        highest level. Table 1 below notes how many Challenge
        Points each PC of a given level represents.</p>

        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Character Level</strong></td>

              <td><strong>Challenge Points</strong></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Lowest</td>

              <td>2</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Second-Lowest</td>

              <td>3</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Second-Highest</td>

              <td>4</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>Highest</td>

              <td>6</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>For example, a 2nd-level PC in a Tier 1&#8211;4
        adventure contributes 3 Challenge Points. A party of five
        PCs levels 1, 2, 3, 4, and 4 would contribute 2, 3, 4, 6,
        and 6 points respectively.</p>

        <p><strong>3: Total the PCs&#8217; Challenge
        Points.</strong> Add these values together to get a sum. In
        the above example of five PCs, the total number of
        Challenge Points is 21 (2+3+4+6+6).</p>

        <p><strong>4: Compare the sum to Table 2: Calculating
        Subtier and Adjustments.</strong> Some of the subtier
        entries reference a 5- or 6-player adjustment, which
        appears in labeled sidebars in each adventure. Some subtier
        entries reference a level bump, which is a small boost to
        obstacles&#8217; DCs and other numbers, as described in
        Applying Modifications below.</p>

        <table>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Total Points</strong></td>

              <td><strong>Subtier</strong></td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td><strong>8&#8211;9</strong></td>

            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td><strong>28-32</strong></td>

              <td>High subtier (5-player adjustment with level bump
              to the adventure)</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td><strong>33&#8211;42</strong></td>

              <td>High subtier (6-player adjustment with level bump
              to the adventure)</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Challenge Point totals of 12&#8211;13 and 23&#8211;27
        allow the GM to make a choice between two options that
        provide a similar degree of challenge. However, each
        scenario varies slightly in the differences between these
        two options, and the GM is encouraged to select the option
        they predict will be a more fun and fair challenge for the
        group. (Parties often prefer options that give the PCs more
        monsters to fight.) You can pick between the options
        individually for each encounter.</p>

        <p><strong>5: Apply a level bump to any PCs who have the
        lowest level within the tier(high subtier only).</strong>
        When a PC is several levels lower than the group&#8217;s
        appropriate subtier, the threats can seem insurmountable
        and overwhelming. When playing in the higher subtier,
        characters of the scenario&#8217;s minimum level (such as a
        3rd-level PC playing in a Tier 3&#8211;6 scenario&#8217;s
        high subtier) gain a temporary boost called a level bump
        (see Applying Adjustments) to provide them a more fun and
        fair experience, representing the higher-level PCs&#8217;
        mentorship and support.</p>

        <p><strong>6: Apply the subtier and the
        adjustments.</strong> See Applying Modifications below for
        more details on using subtiers and applying various
        adjustments.</p>

        <h2>Applying the Modifications</h2>

        <p>Once you&#8217;ve determined the subtier and adjustments
        based on the group&#8217;s Challenge Point total, apply the
        proper modifications to the adventure to provide a fair
        challenge. These take five forms: subtier, player number,
        level bumps for adventures, and level bumps for PCs.</p>

        <p><strong>Subtier:</strong> Nearly all encounters list two
        different sets of creature statistics, one for each of the
        two standard subtiers (ranges of levels the adventure is
        designed for). The adventure often also refers to important
        skill checks and saving throws in room descriptions or
        during events, listing one DC for the lower subtier and one
        for the higher subtier. In each of these cases, use the
        numbers, creatures, and other information listed for the
        selected subtier.</p>

        <p><strong>Player Number:</strong> Scenarios and quests are
        designed for four players with ways to scale up the number
        or severity of threats to accommodate larger groups
        (referred to as the 5-player and 6-player adjustments),
        modeled off the Character Adjustment guidelines found on
        page 489 of the <em>Pathfinder Core Rulebook</em>. These
        adventures list adjustments appropriate for larger groups
        of PCs of equal level in special sidebars. The Challenge
        Point calculation may instruct the GM to apply one of these
        adjustments intended for larger groups (even if the group
        consists of only four PCs).</p>

        <p><strong>Level Bump for Adventures:</strong> Scenarios
        and quests are designed to challenge PCs whose average
        level is the lower of the two levels in a given subtier
        (i.e., Subtier 1&#8211;2 is built to challenge 1st-level
        PCs, and Subtier 3&#8211;4 is built to challenge 3rd-level
        PCs). When the Challenge Point total determines that the
        group&#8217;s overall power is equivalent to the higher
        level in a subtier (e.g. 2nd level in Subtier 1&#8211;2),
        the GM applies a level bump to the entire adventure.
        Applying a level bump is a simple calculation:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Increase every DC listed in the scenario by 1.</li>

          <li>Increase the attack modifiers, attack damage, spell
          damage, saving throw modifiers, skill modifiers,
          Perception modifiers, and ACs of all enemy creatures by
          1.</li>

          <li>Increase the Hit Point totals of all enemy creatures
          by 10 or by 10%, whichever is higher.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These straightforward adjustments make the adventure
        slightly more challenging for higher-level groups, though
        the adjustments cannot account for the more powerful
        abilities and spells that higher-level foes would likely
        have.</p>

        <p><strong>Level Bump for PCs:</strong> When a PC of the
        lowest legal level for an adventure plays in the high
        subtier, they also gain the level bump benefits listed
        above for the duration of the adventure, but instead
        applied to their character&#8217;s Armor Class, DCs,
        modifiers, and Hit Points. These adjustments are less
        beneficial than gaining a level, yet they provide the PC
        more survivability and opportunity to contribute to the
        adventure experience, reducing the degree to which
        higher-level PCs might overshadow these less experienced
        Pathfinders.</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong> Tonya is setting up a Tier
        1&#8211;4 adventure. Her group consists of six players
        whose PCs are levels 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, and 4, giving her a
        Challenge Point total of 25. Table 2 tells Tonya to run
        Subtier 3&#8211;4, but she gets to decide whether to use
        the 6-player adjustment or the level bump. She chooses the
        6-player adjustment because that option adds more enemy
        wererats to the adventure rather than making the wererats
        stronger, which she thinks will be more fun for the
        lower-level PCs.</p>

        <p>For each DC and encounter, Tonya uses the Subtier
        3&#8211;4 statistics. She also applies the 6-player
        adjustments listed in any sidebars in the adventure.
        Finally, she gives the 1st-level PC at her table a level
        bump, increasing that PC&#8217;s ability to contribute in
        this higher-level adventure.</p>

        <h1 id="table-variation">Table Variation</h1>

        <p>While the goal of the Pathfinder Society is to provide
        an even, balanced experience that is fair to all players,
        every table is different, every character is different, and
        each GM has their own strengths and weaknesses. We
        understand that sometimes a Game Master has to make rules
        adjudications on the fly, deal with unexpected player
        choices, or even cope with extremely unlucky (or lucky)
        dice on both sides of the screen.</p>

        <p>Scenarios are meant to be run as written, with no
        addition or subtraction to the number of monsters (unless
        indicated in the scenario), or changes to armor, feats,
        items, skills, spells, statistics, traits, or weapons.
        However, if the actions of the PCs before or during an
        encounter invalidate the provided tactics or starting
        locations, the GM should consider whether changing these
        would provide a more enjoyable play experience.</p>

        <p>As a Pathfinder Society GM, you have the right and
        responsibility to make whatever judgments, within the
        rules, that you feel are necessary at your table to ensure
        everyone has a fair and fun experience. This does not mean
        you can contradict rules or restrictions outlined in this
        document, a published Pathfinder source, errata document,
        or official FAQ on <strong>paizo.com</strong>. What it does
        mean is that only you can judge what is right for your
        table during cases not covered in these sources.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the GM can choose to use terrain and
        environmental conditions when those effects have been
        written into the flavor of a scenario but the mechanics
        associated with such conditions in the <em>Pathfinder</em>
        <em>Core</em> <em>Rulebook</em> have not been added to the
        encounters. GMs are always encouraged to reward roleplaying
        when adjudicating the reactions of NPCs or the outcome of
        in-game encounters.</p>

        <p>GMs may not change the mechanics of encounters.
        Specifically, for combat encounters, the mechanics include
        the creatures presented, the number of opponents in the
        encounter, and the information written into the stat blocks
        for those opponents. If an encounter is a trap, haunt, or
        skill check that needs to be achieved to bypass a situation
        then the listed DCs and results are not to be altered, as
        they are the mechanics of that encounter. Additionally, if
        an encounter already includes mechanical effects of
        terrain, weather, or hazards, please be aware that these
        things are also considered mechanics that may not be
        altered. GMs also cannot alter the mechanics of player
        characters, nor can they ban legal character options from
        public events.</p>

        <p>By contrast, the GM can alter aspects of the
        scenario&#8217;s description and story as appropriate for
        the players at the table. The section A Welcoming
        Environment on pages 485&#8211;486 of the <em>Core
        Rulebook</em> provides general guidance about how to make
        your game inviting and inclusive. A few of these sections
        benefit from additional clarification and examples in the
        context of Organized Play.</p>

        <p>Unlike in long-term campaigns, players and GMs in
        Organized Play are likely to have limited time in which to
        set parameters for objectionable content at the beginning
        of the game. Furthermore, since Organized Play tables often
        include people who have never met each other before the
        game, players may not feel comfortable opening up about
        what they&#8217;d rather avoid right from the beginning.
        &nbsp;This means that it&#8217;s all the more important to
        start with a common ground for the campaign, to respect
        what players do share at the beginning of the session, and
        then be adaptable when it comes to modifying content when
        problems arise in the course of the session. Pathfinder
        Society games use the Pathfinder Baseline from page 486 as
        a starting point when determining what content is
        appropriate, both for what is present in the published
        adventures and what is appropriate for player behavior at
        your table. Add to the Pathfinder Baseline any additional
        adjustments that are apparent from the situation, such as
        if you are running a table with children or if you are in a
        venue with stronger policies about what is appropriate,
        such as a school.</p>

        <p>GMs are empowered to make descriptive adjustments to
        avoid topics or situations that would cause discomfort for
        one or more players at the table, such as phobias or other
        triggering material. For example, a GM could describe a
        group of spiders as a group of web-shooting lizards or
        beetles for the comfort of a player with arachnophobia.
        Mechanically, if a player had an ability that granted
        benefits against spiders, it would also grant benefits
        against these other web-shooting creatures during that
        scenario. Players may not tell you up-front about
        everything that could cause them trouble; you may learn
        partway through the session. If this happens, you can
        &#8220;rewind&#8221; the description and start over,
        tweaking the background context of the encounter, or work
        with the players to create an alternative solution to get
        around the troublesome aspect of a particular challenge
        (see Creative Solutions
        below).</p>

        <p>As is the case in general when GMing a table, it is also
        the GM&#8217;s responsibility to ensure that all of the
        players at the table are respecting each other&#8217;s
        boundaries. If a player refuses to follow along with the
        adjustment, pushes boundaries, asks insensitive question,
        or makes fun of a player voicing discomfort with an aspect
        of the scenario, the GM should intervene. This intervention
        may just involve giving the player a warning about their
        inappropriate behavior, but in egregious or continued
        cases, the GM can remove the offending player from her
        table (see 
        Community Standards ).</p>

        <p>Whatever changes the GM makes, she should remain true to
        the fundamental mechanical structure and challenge of the
        encounter. See the Creative Solutions section below for
        guidance on how to adjudicate solutions that are not
        explicitly accounted for in the text of the adventure.</p>

        <p>If a particular issue comes up repeatedly or causes a
        significant problem in one of your games, please raise any
        questions or concerns on the Pathfinder Society forums at
        <strong>pathfindersociety.club</strong>,
        where Venture-Officers, members of Paizo&#8217;s organized
        play team, or fellow GMs can help you resolve it. Even if
        there were unlimited time to address such concerns,
        however, there would always be slight table variation and
        Game Master discretion. The following sections provide
        advice on addressing some common table variations you
        should consider before running a Pathfinder Society
        game.</p>

        <h2 id="creative-solutions">Creative Solutions</h2>

        <p>Sometimes during the course of a scenario, your players
        might surprise you with a creative solution to an encounter
        (or the entire scenario) that you didn&#8217;t see coming
        and that isn&#8217;t expressly covered in the scenario. If,
        for example, your players manage to roleplay their way
        through a combat and successfully accomplish the goal of
        that encounter without killing the antagonist, give the PCs
        the same reward they would have gained had they defeated
        their opponent in combat. If that scene specifically calls
        for the PCs to receive gold piece rewards based on the gear
        collected from the defeated combatants, instead allow the
        PCs to find a chest of gold (or something similar) that
        gives them the same rewards. Additionally, if the PCs miss
        an NPC who carries a specific potion or scroll that the PCs
        might be granted access to on the scenario&#8217;s
        Chronicle sheet, don&#8217;t cross that item off the
        sheet&#8212;instead, allow the PCs to find the item
        elsewhere as a reward for creatively resolving the
        encounter without resorting to combat.</p>

        <p>The Pathfinder Society never wants to give the
        impression that the only way to solve a problem is to kill
        it. Rewarding the creative use of skills and roleplaying
        not only make Society games more fun for the players, but
        it also gives the GM a level of flexibility in ensuring
        players receive the rewards they are due.</p>

        <p>But what if your players accidentally or intentionally
        kill an important NPC who was supposed to give them a
        crucial piece of information that&#8217;s needed for the
        scenario to progress? This is a tough problem for the GM
        and requires improvisation. Don&#8217;t decide the scenario
        is over just because the old man with the letter was caught
        in a magical crossfire and roasted alive, destroying both
        him and the important letter. Reveal that the letter
        survived by some twist of fate (it was in a fire-proof
        pouch in his pocket) or maybe that the old man had a lackey
        who was watching from a nearby alley and knows everything
        the old man did, or another similar explanation.
        Improvisation will keep your scenario moving forward and
        help you work around unforeseen obstacles. For more
        guidance on handling the PCs&#8217; treasure and rewards
        when they use creative solutions, see the Treasure Bundles
        section.</p>

        <h2>Secret Checks</h2>

        <p>In Pathfinder Second Edition, some checks, such as
        checks to Recall Knowledge, have the secret trait. Secret
        checks fall into two broad categories. The first category
        includes checks that characters do not know exist, such as
        a check against a hidden threat that the PCs did not
        notice. The second category includes checks for which
        players would gain significant extra information that their
        characters would not have if they knew how well they
        rolled. Recall Knowledge checks are the broadest type of
        checks that fall into this category. Characters that
        critically fail a Recall Knowledge check gain false
        information, so if players know that they rolled very low,
        they may have trouble avoiding metagaming. Similarly, if
        the players all rolled low on a check to Seek, they may
        find themselves tempted to metagame and have everyone roll
        again because they know that there is likely something that
        they didn&#8217;t find.</p>

        <p>The secret trait is a tool to help separate character
        knowledge and player knowledge, but, as listed in the
        secret check rules on page 450 of the <em>Core
        Rulebook</em>, GMs may at any time allow their players to
        roll their own results on secret checks. Some scenarios
        will make recommendations, such as directing GMs to keep a
        particularly pivotal check&#8217;s results hidden or to let
        players roll a string of checks in the open to keep
        gameplay moving. Unless a scenario says otherwise, GMs are
        free to choose how to handle secret checks on a
        check-by-check basis. GMs can keep all secret checks
        secret, have players roll all secret checks, or adapt on
        the fly based on the mood and pacing of the table. If
        players rolling their own secret checks do
        metagame&#8212;that is, use information that their
        characters would not have to determine their
        actions&#8212;then inform them that their characters would
        not have that information and try to steer them away from
        using it. In general, it can be useful to have players roll
        their own checks if there are many secret rolls in one
        section, and useful to roll for the players if you suspect
        that there will be a strong temptation to metagame or that
        the extra information of the result could negatively impact
        the experience for players at the table.</p>

        <h1 id="treasure-bundles">Treasure Bundles</h1>

        <p>In Pathfinder Society adventures in the Second Edition
        campaign, PCs recover wealth in the form of Treasure
        Bundles&#8212;a simplified unit that represents an even
        share of the adventure&#8217;s rewards, used for ease of
        tracking and calculation. Each scenario (designed to grant
        4 XP) has a 10 such Treasure Bundles. The Chronicle sheets
        for quests, Adventure Paths, and Pathfinder Adventures
        products grant a standardized gold reward.</p>

        <p><strong>Variation by Level:</strong> The Second Edition
        campaign grants each participating PC an amount of wealth
        based on that PC&#8217;s level, no matter the
        adventure&#8217;s tier or the subtier used. For example, a
        Tier 1&#8211;4 scenario would grant 52 gp for a 1st-level
        PC and 152 to a 3rd-level PC, whether they played Subtier
        1&#8211;2 or 3&#8211;4.</p>

        <p><strong>Tracking Treasure Bundles:</strong> Key
        encounter areas and events in a Pathfinder Society Scenario
        list how many Treasure Bundles the associated rewards are
        worth. Each PC earns the same number of Treasure Bundles as
        the other PCs; some player boons or scenarios might grant
        an unequal number of Treasure Bundles, but these are
        infrequent exceptions.</p>

        <p>At the end of an adventure, the GM should tally the
        number of Treasure Bundles the PCs acquired. For non-quest
        adventures, each PC receives the gold that corresponds to
        their level on Table 3
        below, multiplied by the number of Treasure Bundles they
        recovered. If you prefer, you can instead multiply the
        number of missed Treasure Bundles by the corresponding gold
        value and subtract that from the Chronicle sheet&#8217;s
        maximum reward. The math works out the same either way. If
        you would prefer to consult a table rather than doing the
        math, see Table 4
        below.</p>

        <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Tonya is the GM for the
        scenario, and her players are John (with a 1st-level
        character), Mike (2nd-level), Thurston (3rd-level), and
        Linda (4th-level). The team played exceptionally well and
        found all 10 Treasure Bundles&#8212;the maximum reward!
        Tonya awards each PC the maximum gold piece reward for
        their respective levels: John&#8217;s PC gets 14 gp as a
        1st-level PC, Mike&#8217;s gets 22 gp, Thurston&#8217;s
        gets 38 gp, and Linda&#8217;s gets 64 gp.</p>

        <p>Later that weekend, the same group plays another
        scenario. This time the group struggles, earning only 7
        Treasure Bundles. When calculating the gold earned by
        John&#8217;s PC, Tonya takes the Treasure Bundle value on
        the table for a 1st-level PC (1.4) and multiplies it by the
        number of Treasure Bundles (7) to get his PC&#8217;s final
        gold earned: 9.8 gp. Alternatively, Tonya could have
        multiplied the missing Treasure Bundles (3) by the value
        (1.4) and subtracted the product from the scenario&#8217;s
        maximum reward for 1st level (14 &#8211; [3 x 1.4] = 9.8
        gp). The other PCs would earn 15.4 gp (Mike), 26.6 gp
        (Thurston), and 44.8 gp (Linda).</p>

        <p><strong>Expectations and Creative Solutions:</strong> In
        the course of completing a scenario, the PCs are likely to
        acquire all 10 Treasure Bundles as part of overcoming
        challenges and inspecting their surroundings. That said, a
        non-linear adventure might include encounter areas (and
        treasure) the PCs miss entirely, and there might be small
        portions of treasure that a group would overlook entirely
        (such as hidden in a concealed room). As a result, even a
        capable party might not secure all 10 Treasure Bundles.
        Taking into account the free consumable items granted to
        PCs at the beginning of adventures, the wealth earned by
        Pathfinder Society characters is slightly higher than the
        standard provided in the Core Rulebook. That means that
        although missing the occasional Treasure Bundle stings,
        it&#8217;s accounted for in the campaign.</p>

        <p>However, awarding fewer than the maximum Treasure
        Bundles shouldn&#8217;t be a punitive tool. Unless
        recovering a Treasure Bundle is tied to succeeding at key
        skill checks or making key choices, PCs who overcome an
        encounter with creative solutions should earn the same
        reward they would have earned by defeating that foe in
        combat. Adventures call out special exceptions, such as
        treasure only accessible if the PCs investigate a
        particular secret door or agree to an NPC&#8217;s proposal.
        If the PCs&#8217; actions allow them to bypass the area or
        encounter where they would have the chance to recover the
        treasure, it&#8217;s okay to relocate the opportunity to a
        later point with similar requirements to recover the
        treasure.</p>

        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The PCs are supposed to attack
        a keep, and they successfully trick the guards into
        escorting the PCs to the final encounter with the evil
        warlord rather than fighting their way in. By tricking the
        guards, the PC not only skip the guards fight (which has 2
        Treasure Bundles associated with it) and never have a
        chance to pick up the easily-discovered magic wand in the
        guardroom (1 additional Treasure Bundle), but they also
        skip a fight with a minotaur (who guards coins representing
        2 Treasure Bundles). The PCs should receive credit for
        these rewards anyway; they overcame the guards encounter,
        bypassed the minotaur, and would have easily recovered the
        treasure afterward.</p>

        <p>However, escorting the PCs through the keep also means
        the PCs neither explore the side rooms nor have a chance to
        find the secret vault where a golden chalice is hidden (1
        Treasure Bundle). Finding this vault would have required a
        PC Searching during exploration and succeeding at a DC 20
        Perception check, and the room&#8217;s rewards cite that
        the PCs should only receive this reward if they find the
        room and recover the chalice. In this case the PCs should
        have a fair opportunity to find the chalice anyway, such as
        the secret door and room being relocated to the
        warlord&#8217;s throne room with the same Perception check
        DC.</p>

        <h1 id="infamy-and-alignment-infractions">Infamy and
        Alignment Infractions</h1>

        <p>Players are responsible for their characters&#8217;
        actions. A player&#8217;s perception of what their
        character would do in a particular situation is never more
        important than the experience of other players at the
        table.</p>

        <p>Alignment infractions&#8212;evil acts committed by PCs
        in Organized Play&#8212;are a touchy subject. Killing an
        innocent, wanton destruction, and other acts that can be
        construed as evil might be considered alignment
        infractions. Ultimately, you are the final authority at the
        table, but you must warn any player whose character is
        deviating from his chosen alignment. This warning must be
        clear, and you must make sure that the player understands
        the warning and the actions that initiated the warning. The
        PC should be given the opportunity to correct the behavior,
        justify it, or face the consequences. You can issue a
        warning to the player through a &#8220;feeling&#8221; he
        receives from his deity, a vision he is given, his
        conscience talking to him, or some other similar
        roleplaying event.</p>

        <p><strong>Infamy:</strong> When a character expresses the
        intent to perform a wantonly evil or callously criminal
        action and you inform them that their action would be
        considered an evil action, if the character still persists
        in performing the action, apply a point of Infamy to the
        character. Up to a certain limit, gaining Infamy does not
        mandate a change in the character&#8217;s alignment, but
        rather, represents a step towards becoming evil.</p>

        <p>Beyond GM intervention, some scenarios and written
        products may present evil solutions to situations. These
        actions will be called out within the adventure text as
        causes to give a character partaking in them a point of
        Infamy. Still, the GM is the final arbiter on what
        constitutes an alignment infraction and when Infamy is
        gained by a character at the table.</p>

        <p>Every point of Infamy represents the PC&#8217;s
        reputation for performing evil actions. A character can
        have a maximum of 3 Infamy before that character must be
        retired; it is assumed characters with 3 points of Infamy
        become irrevocably evil and are no longer welcome to join
        standard Pathfinder Society operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Removing Infamy:</strong> A player can reduce
        their character&#8217;s Infamy by spending 12 Fame per
        point or through the 
        Untarnished Reputation faction boon</p>

        <p><strong>Effects of Infamy:</strong> A character can have
        an Infamy score between 0 and 3. The following summarizes
        the effects of Infamy based on the number of points
        accrued:</p>

        <p>0: No effect. The character is considered in excellent
        moral standing with the Pathfinder Society.</p>

        <p>1: The character has earned a reputation for performing
        unseemly deeds. The maximum item level of equipment the
        character can purchase decreases by 1 (to a minimum of
        level 1 equipment). This typically means that the PC can
        purchase equipment with an item level equal to their level
        &#8211; 1 and can purchase equipment listed on a Chronicle
        sheet only if its level is at most 1 higher than their
        level.</p>

        <p>2: The character is infamous for her evil exploits in
        the name of the Pathfinder Society. The maximum item level
        of equipment the character can purchase decreases by 2 (to
        a minimum of level 1 equipment). This typically means the
        PCs can purchase equipment with an item level equal to her
        level &#8211; 2. A PC with this level of Infamy can
        purchase equipment listed on her Chronicle sheets only if
        its level is equal to or less than her level.</p>

        <p>3: The character has earned such a reputation that they
        are barred from participating in Pathfinder Society, unless
        they reduce their Infamy score to 2 or lower at the end of
        the adventure. If the character don&#8217;t reduce their
        Infamy score, the character is permanently retired from
        play.</p>

        <p><strong>Major Infractions:</strong> Characters who
        become wantonly evil by performing vile actions are retired
        from the campaign when they reach 3 Infamy and cannot
        reduce the value by spending Fame. This measure is a last
        resort; players should endeavor to play their characters in
        ways that are within the constraints of acceptable
        alignments, even if their characters have gained some
        Infamy.</p>

        <p>If a character is retired as defined above, you should
        escalate the report to the event coordinator, or the local
        Venture-Captain or Regional Venture-Coordinator. If that
        Venture-Officer agrees with you, then the character is
        deemed wantonly evil and considered removed from the
        campaign. Again, these measures should be taken as a very
        last resort.</p>

        <p>In the event of a wantonly evil character, record the
        character as &#8220;dead,&#8221; and the person who enters
        the tracking sheet should check that box as well. If the
        event coordinator, Venture-Captain, or Regional
        Venture-Coordinator decides the character fits the criteria
        for being wantonly evil, she will then e-mail the Organized
        Play manager to advise her of the situation, including the
        player&#8217;s name, organized play number, and e-mail
        address. A player must be advised of these actions and be
        provided with a chance to contact their Regional
        Venture-Coordinator to present their side of the case.</p>

        <h1>Dealing with Death</h1>

        <p>Given the dangers characters face once they become
        Pathfinders, character death is a very real possibility
        (and a necessary one to maintain a sense of risk and danger
        in the game). Consider, however, that for a player new to
        Pathfinder Society, or to the Pathfinder RPG in general,
        having his character experience a violent death during his
        first game can sour him on the campaign and the game
        altogether. While we don&#8217;t advocate fudging die
        rolls, consider the experience of the players when deciding
        whether to use especially lethal tactics or if a character
        is in extreme danger of death, especially when the player
        is new to the game. Most players whose first experience in
        a campaign results in a character death don&#8217;t return
        to the campaign.</p>

        <p>Similarly, if the entire party is killed and can&#8217;t
        be brought back to life, then the slot is over for everyone
        in the party. This means those players may have a
        substantial span of time before their next event at a
        convention with no game to play. Obviously, we hope that
        such total party kills never happen (and strive to balance
        the scenarios to make it unlikely)&#8212;but, sometimes,
        the dice just aren&#8217;t with you and everyone passes
        into the Great Beyond.</p>

        <h1>Cheating</h1>

        <p>Cheating is rare, and it can be a rather heated topic.
        If you suspect that a player is cheating, it&#8217;s always
        a good idea to take a step back and consider the
        possibility that they are instead making an honest mistake.
        Inaccurate numbers on a character sheet or mistakes on a
        Chronicle sheet are far more likely to be math errors than
        deliberate cheating. When you see these issues, keep an
        open mind and work with the player to resolve them. Other
        issues, such as lying about the results of a dice roll or
        the contents of their character sheet or breaking the rules
        even after being informed of what they are, are more
        clear-cut. If you believe the player to be cheating, record
        the organized play number of the player in question and
        then ask her to leave your table. Afterward, send an e-mail
        to the Pathfinder Society staff at organizedplay@paizo.com,
        including the player&#8217;s number and detailing as much
        as you can remember about the situation.</p>

        <h1 id="gm-glyph-rewards">GM Glyph Rewards</h1>

        <p>The Pathfinder Society offers a GM ranking system. This
        system uses glyphs to denote the activity and experience of
        a given GM. The glyphs are visible on your Organized Play
        ID card. You can earn up to four glyphs for running a
        certain number of reported games, as follows.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Report 10 adventures as GM = 1 glyph</li>

          <li>Report 30 adventures as GM = 2 glyphs</li>

          <li>Report 60 adventures as GM = 3 glyphs</li>

          <li>Report 100 adventures as GM = 4 glyphs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are additional requirements beyond number of
        tables reported to earn 5 glyphs. More information on the
        fifth glyph will be added to this page in the future.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>All GMs receive the following rewards based on the
        number of GM glyphs that they have earned.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>When playing a scenario, they can distribute a number
          of Hero Points equal to their number of glyphs to the
          other players at the table. Distribute these Hero Points
          during the portion of the scenario in which players are
          slotting boons. A player cannot gain more than one Hero
          Point from the table&#8217;s GM glyphs.</li>

          <li>They gain the ability to 
          replay an adventure that grants one Chronicle sheet
          once per glyph earned.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Paizo recognizes all 5-glyph GMs by name on blogs on
